<h3>Participation Information Sheet</h3>

<p>Before you attend your first meeting, please complete and return the <a href="/sites/default/files/participant-info-202009.doc" target="_blank">Participant Information Sheet</a>.</p>

<h3>Hotel Reservations</h3>

<p>Board members are allowed to stay overnight at government expense based on the current lodging per diem for our area. If you need to stay overnight, we strongly suggest that you complete and submit a <a href="/travel/hotel-request">Hotel Request</a> in the Editorial Board Management System (EBMS) or fax the <a href="/sites/default/files/hotel-request-202009.docx" target="_blank">completed form</a> to Klem Kadiddlehopper (contact information above) so we can make and pay for your reservation.</p>

<p>If you prefer to make your own reservations, you may request the government per diem rate, but hotels are not obligated to grant this rate to you. If you cannot find a room at the government rate, please contact your Board Manager for assistance. If lodging is not available at the government rate, your Board Manager may request approval to exceed the government rate. If you do not receive approval for this in advance, the government might not reimburse you for more than the maximum allowable rate. Please note that we are not authorized to reimburse you if you choose to stay at an airbnb property.</p>

<p>The Federal government&apos;s maximum lodging allowance (not including tax) for our area for the 2022 fiscal year is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>$257.00 per night Oct 1, 2021 - Oct 31, 2021</li>
  <li>$188.00 per night Nov 1, 2021 - Feb 28, 2022</li>
  <li>$258.00 per night March 1, 2022 - June 30, 2022</li>
  <li>$172.00 per night July 1, 2022 - Aug 31, 2022</li>
  <li>$257.00 per night Sept 1, 2022 - Sept 30, 2022</li>
</ul>

<p>It can be very difficult to find a room at the government rate, so please make your reservations or submit your request as early as possible.</p>

<h3>Meals and Incidental Expenses (M&amp;IE)</h3>

<p>The Federal government’s maximum M&amp;IE allowance is $79.00 per day on non-travel days, which is calculated as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Breakfast $18.00</li>
  <li>Lunch $20.00</li>
  <li>Dinner: $36.00</li>
  <li>Incidentals: $5.00</li>
</ul>

<p>The maximum M&amp;IE is $59.25 (75% of the total amount) on travel days. When meals are paid for by the government (e,g., when we provide lunch at the Board meeting), the corresponding amount is deducted from your M&amp;IE reimbursement.</p>

<p>You may request the maximum amount each day and it is not necessary to send receipts for M&amp;IE. Refer to the Travel Expense Statement for more information.</p>

<h3>Transportation</h3>

<p>You may request reimbursement for parking at the airport or train station and for taxis, Uber, or Lyft for travel between your home, the airport or train station, our building, and your hotel. Please submit receipts for costs over $75.00. <strong>We are NOT authorized to reimburse you for rental cars, car services, or limousines.</strong> If the transportation options from your home to the airport or train station are limited, please contact your Board Manager to discuss your options.</p>

<h3>Requesting Reimbursement</h3>

<p>After you attend a meeting, complete and submit a <a href="/travel/reimbursement-request">Reimbursement Request</a> in the EBMS or complete the <a href="/sites/default/files/expense-statement-202111.docx" target="_blank">Travel Expense Statement</a> and submit by mail or fax, or electronically (with scanned receipts), to Klem for reimbursement. (You can make a master copy of the statement and make copies of it as needed.)</p>

<p>You will be reimbursed for your travel expenses and paid your $200.00 honorarium by check within 30 days of receiving your properly completed expense statement and all pertinent receipts.</p>

<p>You do not need to submit receipts for meals (we will automatically reimburse you for the maximum allowable amount) and you only need to submit parking or taxi receipts for expenses over $75.00. You do not need to submit your hotel receipt if We Are Hotels already paid your bill.</p>
