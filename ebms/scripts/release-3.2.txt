Manual steps for EBMS release 3.2
=================================

Iteration 1
-----------

OCEEBMS-328 [reimbursement request form at /node/2/webform]:

We would like to change the "CONFIRMATION EMAIL" field to "EMAIL" and
make it required.

Please also change the instructional text to the following:

Enter the email address where you would like a confirmation of this request to be sent. We will also use this email to contact you if we have questions about your reimbursement request.

OCEEBMS-242:

Unpublish Local Travel page. Rename Long Distance Travel page to Policies
and Procedures (/admin/structure/menu/manage/ebms-travel-menu and /node/6/edit).

OCEEBMS-235:

Create new About page and populate it with content from about-pdq.html in
scripts folder.

Iteration 2
-----------

OCEEBMS-329:

We would like to remove the word "please" from this form in all places
EXCEPT the first time it appears (first sentence, After you attend a
meeting in person, please complete this form to request reimbursement
for your travel-related expenses., is OK). Each of those sentences can
just begin with the second word.

Under MEALS AND INCIDENTALS add a third check box with the text, "I am
not eligible to receive a per diem". [per_diem_ineligible] 

Under the third box, add explanatory text,

"Board members who live less than 50 miles from our building are not eligible to receive a per diem."

Under REIMBURSEMENT (near the end of the form), please remove the
first sentence, "Please indicate whether you would like your
reimbursement check to be sent to the work or home address we have on
file." We have that sentence twice, and want to leave it after the
check boxes.

After the TOTAL AMOUNT REQUESTED field, please change the wording to say,

"You may enter the total amount you are requesting, including reimbursement for all expenses and your honorarium, or you may leave this field blank. We will calculate your mileage and per diem amount (if requested) and add that to your reimbursement."
