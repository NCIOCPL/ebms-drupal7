TI  - ASXL1 promotes adrenocortical carcinoma and is associated with chemoresistance to 
      EDP regimen.
LID - 10.18632/aging.203534 [doi]
AB  - Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare but aggressive disease that lacks 
      definitive treatment. We aim to evaluate role of ASXL1 in ACC and exploit its 
      therapeutic merits therein. We performed in silico reproduction of datasets of the 
      Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), GDSC (Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer) and Human 
      Protein Atlas using platforms of cBioPortal, UALCAN, NET-GE, GSEA and GEPIA. 
      Validation in ACC was performed in tissue, in vitro and in vivo using the NCI-H295R 
      and SW-13 cells. ASXL1 was gained in over 50% of ACC cases with its mRNA 
      overexpressed in DNA gained cases. ASXL1 overexpression was associated with 
      recurrence and worsened prognosis in ACC. ASXL1 gain was associated with resistance 
      to etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin (EDP). ASXL1 expression was positively 
      correlated with FSCN1 expression. Targeting ASXL1 significantly impaired fitness of 
      ACC cells, which could be in part rescued by FSCN1 overexpression. Targeting FSCN1 
      however could not rescue resistance to EDP induced by ASXL1 overexpression. 
      Targeting ASXL1 sensitized ACC cells to EDP regimen but constitutive ASXL3 
      overexpression in SW-13 cells could induce resistance upon prolonged treatment. 
      Functional gain of ASXL1 was common in ACC and exerted pro-tumorigenic and 
      chemoresistance role. Targeting ASXL1 hold promise to ACC treatment.

AB  - Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy characterized by aggressive 
      biology and potential endocrine activity. Surgery can offer cure for localized 
      disease but more than half of patients relapse and primary unresectable or 
      metastasized disease is frequent. Prognosis of metastatic ACC is still limited, with 
      less than 15% of patients alive at 5 years. Recent advances in understanding the 
      molecular profile of ACC underline the high complexity of this disease, which is 
      characterized by limited drugable molecular targets as well as by a complex 
      interplay between a yet scarcely understood microenvironment and potential endocrine 
      activity. Particularly steroid-excess further complicates therapeutic concepts such 
      as immunotherapy, which have markedly improved outcome in other disease entities. To 
      date, mitotane remains the only approved drug for adjuvant and palliative care in 
      ACC. Standard chemotherapy-based protocols with cisplatin, doxorubicin and etoposide 
      offer only marginal improvement in long-term outcome and the number of clinical 
      trials conducted is low due to the rarity of the disease. In the current review, we 
      summarize principles of oncological management for ACC from localized to advanced 
      disease and discuss novel therapeutic strategies, including targeted therapies such 
      as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antibodies, immunotherapy with a focus on 
      checkpoint inhibitors, individualized treatment concepts based on molecular 
      characterization by next generation sequencing methods, the role of theranostics and 
      evolvement of adjuvant therapy.

TI  - Telomeric zinc-finger associated protein (TZAP) in cancer biology: friend or foe?
PG  - 121-129
LID - 10.22099/mbrc.2021.40106.1607 [doi]
AB  - The new identified protein telomeric zinc-finger associated protein (TZAP) is a 
      negative regulator of telomere length. Since telomere length and telomere 
      maintenance mechanisms are essential to cancer progression, TZAP is considered a new 
      player in cancer biology. Here we aimed to analyze TZAP using the Cancer Genome 
      Atlas data in a Pan-Cancer approach. We gathering data from TCGA Pan-Cancer studies 
      utilizing cBioPortal, GEPIA and UALCAN. In total we analyzed 33 types of cancer 
      (n=9664) and their respective controls (n=711). TZAP is transcribed in all cancers 
      but less than 5% of all tumors show any somatic changes. TZAP was downregulated in 
      kidney chromophobe carcinoma, and upregulated in esophageal cancer, head and neck 
      squamous cell carcinomas, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and in liver 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Globally, TZAP expression is related to favorable 
      prognosis, associated to better overall and disease-free survival. Looking to 
      specific tumors, TZAP expression has a dual behavior. Its downregulation is 
      associated with poor prognosis in cervical squamous cell carcinoma, in kidney renal 
      clear cell carcinoma, kidney papillary cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and 
      pancreas adenocarcinoma. On the contrary, in adrenocortical carcinoma, colon and 
      rectal cancer, brain lower grade glioma and prostate adenocarcinoma the upregulation 
      of TZAP is related with poor prognosis. TZAP expression has a positive correlation 
      with TRF1 and TRF2 in normal tissue but not in cancer. Our analyses indicate that 
      TZAP has an important role in oncology and may be considered as a potential 
      biomarker.

      carcinoma.
PG  - 3275-3285
LID - 10.21037/tau-21-232 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an extremely rare malignant tumor with 
      poor prognosis. Existing treatment options have limited effects, and new therapeutic 
      targets urgently need to be discovered. TNFSF13B has been reported to be associated 
      with the prognosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma, but it has not been studied 
      in ACC. METHODS: TNFSF13B expression was analyzed and compared between ACC tumors 
      and normal tissues by using public datasets from TCGA and GTEx. Kaplan-Meier 
      analysis was employed to evaluate survival, and Cox regression was employed to 
      evaluate clinicopathologic features. The upstream and downstream regulatory 
      mechanisms of TNFSF13B were also analyzed. GSEA was performed to explore the 
      mechanisms of TNFSF13B in ACC. Finally, 14 ACC clinical samples were used to verify 
      the relationships between TNFSF13B expression and disease-free survival (DFS) and 
      overall survival (OS). RESULTS: TNFSF13B expression was significantly higher in ACC 
      tissues than in normal tissues. The prognosis of ACC patients with high TNFSF13B 
      expression was worse than that of patients with low TNFSF13B expression. High 
      TNFSF13B expression was strongly correlated with poor prognosis, and TNFSF13B was a 
      prognostic factor. TNFSF13B expression is modified by upstream miRNAs, methylation 
      and ubiquitination, and downstream, it interacts with other proteins. GSEA showed 
      that regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by SREBP and SREBF, downstream signaling 
      events of the B cell receptor (BCR) and activation of gene expression by SREBF and 
      SREBP were significantly enriched in the TNFSF13B high-expression phenotype. 
      Clinical samples confirmed that TNFSF13B expression was significantly associated 
      with DFS but not with OS. CONCLUSIONS: TNFSF13B may be a potential prognostic 
      molecular marker of poor survival in ACC patients, offering a new therapeutic 
      target.

AB  - PURPOSE: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy with poor prognosis, 
      and researchers are interested in further studying its diagnosis and treatment. Our 
      study aims to identify new potential therapeutic targets in ACC. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: The core genes CDK1 and CCNB1 were previously screened using ACC data from 
      The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as the most relevant to Bclaf1 and tumour prognosis. 
      We used siRNA- or shRNA-based models to explore the role of Bcl-2-associated 
      transcription factor 1 (Bclaf1) in SW-13 cell lines. Western blotting and qPCR were 
      used to determine the effects of Bclaf1 on CDK1 and Cyclin B1. RESULTS: Based on 
      biological information analysis, we found that Bcl-2-associated transcription factor 
      1 (Bclaf1) affected the progression of ACC and was associated with the cell cycle. 
      Downregulated Bclaf1 expression inhibited the proliferation of SW-13 cells and 
      affected the cell cycle process of SW-13 cells. BCLAF1 was correlated with CDK1 and 
      CCNB1 and can regulate their mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSION: Bclaf1 might 
      promote the development of ACC by regulating CDK1 and Cyclin B1 to drive mitosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases-1 (PARP1) alterations are associated with 
      PARP1 inhibitor resistance, regulating the function of Treg cells and PDL1 
      expression in tumor cells, and high PARP1 expression is significantly associated 
      with aggressive behavior and chemotherapeutic resistance in several tumors. However, 
      a comprehensive analysis of the predictive values of PARP1 alteration for immune 
      checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) effectiveness in tumors remains unclear, and the 
      associations between its expression and immunotherapy signatures also needs to be 
      explored further. METHODS: We performed some analyses with the cBioPortal online 
      database (https://www.cbioportal.org), TIMER2.0 (Tumor Immune Estimation Resource 
      2.0, http://timer.comp-genomics.org/) and TCGA database (https://xenabrowser.net or 
      https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier 
      method, and the associations between PARP1 transcription levels and immune 
      checkpoint gene expression, the number of neoantigens, tumor mutation burden (TMB) 
      levels, and microsatellite instability (MSI) event are analyzed by spearman 
      correlation analysis and visualization of those mentioned above is performed using 
      R, version 3.6.3 (http://www.r-project.org/). RESULTS: We found that PARP1 was 
      altered in 1338 (2.9%) out of 45604 patients with diverse tumors, which was 
      associated with markedly higher TMB levels in a variety of tumors (P < 0.01). 
      Impressively, patients with PARP1 alterations in advanced tumors showed better 
      overall survival (OS) in the ICI-treated cohort (P = 0.016). PARP1 altered group was 
      substantially correlated with higher immune infiltrates across most tumors, 
      including CD8+ T cells in colorectal adenocarcinoma (P = 0.0061), endometrial 
      carcinoma (P = 0.0033), stomach cancer (P = 0.033), and cervical cancer (P = 0.026), 
      respectively. The PARP1 altered group showed high expression in transcription (P < 
      0.001), and higher expression of LAG3, PDCD1, CTLA-4, and TIGIT (P < 0.05). Higher 
      PARP1 expression was present in 27 tumor compared the corresponding normal tissues 
      using the GTEx and TCGA databases and it had a worse OS in several tumors (P < 
      0.05). Further, high PARP1 expression was significantly associated with six immune 
      cells (B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic 
      cells) in most tumors, including colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), head and neck squamous 
      cell carcinoma (HNSC), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and liver 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) (P < 0.05). In particular, CD8+T cell infiltration, 
      was also positively correlated with high PARP1 expression in bladder urothelial 
      carcinoma (BLCA), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), kidney renal papillary cell 
      carcinoma (KIRP), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), LIHC, pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
      (PAAD), pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), 
      rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), thymoma (THYM), 
      uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), uveal melanoma (UVM) (P < 0.05, no data 
      shown), and PARP1 expression was significantly positively correlated with the 
      transcription levels of some of the 47 immune checkpoint genes, such as CD274, 
      CTLA4, and PDCD1 in several tumors, including PAAD, LIHC, KIRC, HNSC, and BLCA (P < 
      0.05). A significant positive association between PARP1 expression and the number of 
      immune neoantigen was found within COAD, KIRC, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), PAAD and 
      THYM (P < 0.05), and there were also significantly positive correlations between 
      PARP1 expression and TMB in many tumors like adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), COAD, 
      kidney chromophobe (KICH), LGG, LUAD, READ, skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) and 
      stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) (P < 0.05). In addition, high PARP1 expression was 
      positively associated with microsatellite instability event in COAD, KIRP, BRCA, 
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), LGG, READ, UCEC, 
      SKCM and LUAD (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the significance of 
      PARP1 alterations as pan-cancer predictive biomarkers for ICI treatment, and its 
      expression levels seem to be correlated with the status of immunotherapy-associated 
      signatures, thus may be a promising biomarker for predicting ICI response in several 
      tumors.

TI  - Oncocytic Adrenocortical Carcinoma With Low (18)F-FDG Uptake and the Absence of 
      Glucose Transporter 1 Expression.

AB  - Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumor, and some histological variants 
      (oncocytic, myxoid, and sarcomatoid ACCs) have been reported in addition to the 
      conventional ACC. Among these subtypes, oncocytic ACC is histologically 
      characterized by the presence of abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm in the 
      carcinoma cells owing to the accumulation of mitochondria, which generally yields 
      high (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET). 
      Herein, we report the case of a 21-year-old woman with oncocytic ACC with low FDG 
      uptake on PET scan. Her circulating levels of androgens were high, and 
      androgen-synthesis enzymes were detected in carcinoma cells. The patient also had 
      hypocholesterolemia. However, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) was not detected in the 
      tumor, which was considered to account for the low FDG uptake by the tumor. To the 
      best of our knowledge, this is the first case of low FDG uptake by oncocytic ACC 
      without GLUT1 expression. Additionally, since hypocholesterolemia was reported in 3 
      previous reports of androgen-producing tumors, a possible correlation between 
      androgenicity in adrenal tumors and the development of hypocholesterolemia could be 
      postulated; however, further investigations are needed for clarification. This case 
      highlights important information regarding the diversity of ACC and its impact on 
      hypocholesterolemia.

AB  - C1ORF112 is an evolutionarily conserved gene across vertebrates. Over the last 
      decade, studies have suggested that C1ORF112 may play a role in tumorigenesis. Using 
      The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets, we explored the role of C1ORF112 across various 
      tumor types in this study. In most tumor types, C1ORF112 expression was increased in 
      tumor tissues compared to corresponding non-tumor tissues. In patients with certain 
      tumor types, higher C1ORF112 expression was correlated with shorter overall 
      survival, disease-free survival, and progression-free survival. Further analyses of 
      C1ORF112 genetic alteration data showed that C1ORF112 amplification and mutations 
      may have an impact on liver hepatocellular carcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial 
      carcinoma prognosis. In cancers including lower grade glioma and adrenocortical 
      carcinoma, C1ORF112 expression was linked to cancer-associated fibroblast 
      infiltration. Gene Ontology analysis showed that C1ORF112 was co-expressed with 
      genes involved in biological processes such as cell cycle and mitotic regulation. 
      The protein interaction network demonstrated that C1ORF112 physically interacted 
      with RAD51, DMC1, and FIGNL1, which have well characterized functions in DNA repair 
      and cell cycle regulation. This pan-cancer study revealed the prognostic value and 
      oncogenic role of C1ORF112 across multiple tumor types.

TI  - A case of estrogen-secreting adrenocortical carcinoma: Comprehensive 
      immunohistochemical analysis of disorganized steroid genesis.
PG  - 318-321
LID - 10.1002/iju5.12336 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adrenocortical carcinoma rarely secretes estrogens, and little is 
      known regarding the mechanism of intra-tumor estrogen production. We report an 
      estrogen-secreting adrenocortical carcinoma in a postmenopausal woman, where 
      comprehensive immunohistochemical analyses of the resected tumor revealed 
      disorganized steroidogenesis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old woman presented with 
      postmenopausal vaginal bleeding and was found to have a left adrenal tumor. Serum 
      estradiol and testosterone were elevated but they normalized after resection of the 
      tumor, suggestive of adrenocortical carcinoma with disorganized steroidogenesis. 
      Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the tumor expressed aromatase which 
      converts androgens into estrogens. Furthermore, the tumor lacked 17βHSD2, which 
      converts estradiol to estrone, suggesting that estradiol accumulated as the final 
      product of the tumor's steroidogenic pathway. CONCLUSION: The capability of 
      adrenocortical carcinoma to produce estrogen can be demonstrated by comprehensive 
      immunohistochemical analyses of steroidogenic enzymes, such as those reported here.

TI  - The molecular feature of macrophages in tumor immune microenvironment of glioma 
      patients.
PG  - 4603-4618
LID - 10.1016/j.csbj.2021.08.019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gliomas are one of the most common types of primary tumors in central 
      nervous system. Previous studies have found that macrophages actively participate in 
      tumor growth. METHODS: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to 
      identify meaningful macrophage-related gene genes for clustering. Pamr, SVM, and 
      neural network were applied for validating clustering results. Somatic mutation and 
      methylation were used for defining the features of identified clusters. 
      Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the stratified groups after performing 
      elastic regression and principal component analyses were used for the construction 
      of MScores. The expression of macrophage-specific genes were evaluated in tumor 
      microenvironment based on single cell sequencing analysis. A total of 2365 samples 
      from 15 glioma datasets and 5842 pan-cancer samples were used for external 
      validation of MScore. RESULTS: Macrophages were identified to be negatively 
      associated with the survival of glioma patients. Twenty-six macrophage-specific DEGs 
      obtained by elastic regression and PCA were highly expressed in macrophages at 
      single-cell level. The prognostic value of MScores in glioma was validated by the 
      active proinflammatory and metabolic profile of infiltrating microenvironment and 
      response to immunotherapies of samples with this signature. MScores managed to 
      stratify patient survival probabilities in 15 external glioma datasets and 
      pan-cancer datasets, which predicted worse survival outcome. Sequencing data and 
      immunohistochemistry of Xiangya glioma cohort confirmed the prognostic value of 
      MScores. A prognostic model based on MScores demonstrated high accuracy rate. 
      CONCLUSION: Our findings strongly support a modulatory role of macrophages, 
      especially M2 macrophages in glioma progression and warrants further experimental 
      studies.

TI  - An Adrenocortical Carcinoma Evolving After Nine Years of Latency From a Small 
      Adrenal Incidentaloma.

AB  - Adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) are common incidental findings in medical practice with 
      clinical significance. Although most AIs are nonsecretory and nonmalignant, they 
      require a short course of follow-up over one to two years to rule out malignancy or 
      hormonal secretion according to clinical practice guidelines. However, this can 
      result in some adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs) being missed if they transform at a 
      later stage or evolve slowly. Here, we report one such case of an AI, which although 
      remained indolent, eventually transformed into an ACC many years after the initial 
      detection.
