        "paragraph_text": "The genetics behind predisposition to small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) is largely unknown, but there is growing awareness of a familial form of the disease. We aimed to identify germline mutations involved in the carcinogenesis of SI-NETs. The strategy included next-generation sequencing of exome- and/or whole-genome of blood DNA, and in selected cases, tumor DNA, from 24 patients from 15 families with the history of SI-NETs. We identified seven candidate mutations in six genes that were further studied using 215 sporadic SI-NET patients. The result was compared with the frequency of the candidate mutations in three control cohorts with a total of 35,688 subjects. A heterozygous variant causing an amino acid substitution p.(Gly396Asp) in the MutY DNA glycosylase gene (MUTYH) was significantly enriched in SI-NET patients (minor allele frequencies 0.013 and 0.003 for patients and controls respectively) and resulted in odds ratio of 5.09 (95% confidence interval 1.56-14.74; P value\u2009=\u20090.0038). We also found a statistically significant difference in age at diagnosis between familial and sporadic SI-NETs. MUTYH is involved in the protection of DNA from mutations caused by oxidative stress. The inactivation of this gene leads to specific increase of G:C-\u2009>\u2009T:A transversions in DNA sequence and has been shown to cause various cancers in humans and experimental animals. Our results suggest that p.(Gly396Asp) in MUTYH, and potentially other mutations in additional members of the same DNA excision-repair pathway (such as the OGG1 gene) might be involved in driving the tumorigenesis leading to familial and sporadic SI-NETs."

We searched for published systematic reviews and new references from PubMed-MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL and did also a new search spanning the period Jan 1, 1975, until Feb 1, 2016. Studies were eligible if women underwent treatment by excision of a histologically confirmed CIN2+ lesion, with verification of presence or absence of CIN at the resection margins; were tested by cytology or HPV assay between 3 months and 9 months after treatment; and had subsequent follow-up of at least 18 months post-treatment including histological confirmation of the occurrence of CIN2+. Primary endpoints were the proportion of positive section margins and the occurrence of treatment failure associated with the marginal status, in which treatment failure was defined as occurrence of residual or recurrent CIN2+. Information about positive resection margins and subsequent treatment failure was pooled using procedures for meta-analysis of binomial data and analysed using random-effects models.",

Intravesical BCG plus IFN-\u03b1 versus intravesical BCG alone (four RCTs): We observed no clear difference between BCG plus IFN-\u03b1 and BCG alone for recurrence (average risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.32; 4 RCTs; 925 participants; very low-quality evidence) or progression (average RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.87; 2 RCTs; 219 participants; low-quality evidence). The included RCTs did not report on the other primary outcome of this review, discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events. Regarding secondary outcomes, we observed no clear difference for disease-specific mortality (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.05 to 3.05; 1 RCT; 99 participants; very low-quality evidence). Two RCTs reporting contradictory findings for adverse events could not be pooled due to variation in definitions. There were no data from the included RCTs on time-to-death or disease-specific quality of life. Intravesical BCG alternating with IFN-\u03b1 versus intravesical BCG alone (one RCT): We observed shorter time-to-recurrence for participants in the BCG alternating with IFN-\u03b1 group compared with the BCG alone group (hazard ratio (HR) 2.86, 95% CI 1.98 to 4.13; 1 RCT; 205 participants; low-quality evidence), but no clear differences in time-to-progression (HR 2.39, 95% CI 0.92 to 6.21; 1 RCT; 205 participants; low-quality evidence) and discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events (RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.31 to 28.09; 1 RCT; 205 participants; low-quality evidence).

This review aimed to assess the efficacy of acupuncture in treating CIPN. Method: A literature review following the PRISMA Statement was performed, searching 7 databases from inception through August 2019. All studies were clinical trials of the effect of acupuncture on CIPN. The methodological quality of these trials was assessed using Cochrane criteria; meta-analysis software (RevMan 5.2) was used to analyze the data. Data Sources: The databases searched were the following: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Scopus, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and Wanfang Med Online. Results: We examined 386 cancer patients from 6 randomized control trials, which had high quality, based on the modified Jadad scale. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncture led to significant improvements in pain scores (-1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.61 to -0.82, P < .00001) and nervous system symptoms based on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Neurotoxicity questionnaire scores (-2.02, 95% CI = -2.21 to -1.84, P < .00001). No significant change was noted in nerve conduction velocity (1.58, 95% CI = -2.67 to 5.83, P = .47). Conclusion: Acupuncture can effectively relieve CIPN pain and functional limitation. The limited number of subjects warrants a larger scale study."

        "paragraph_text": "Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are heterogeneous neoplasms which represent only 2% of all pancreatic neoplasms by incidence, but 10% by prevalence. Genetic risk factors could have an important role in the disease aetiology, however only a small number of case control studies have been performed yet. To further our knowledge, we genotyped 13 SNPs belonging to the pleiotropic CDKN2A/B gene region in 320 PNET cases and 4436 controls, the largest study on the disease so far. We observed a statistically significant association between the homozygotes for the minor allele of the rs2518719 SNP and an increased risk of developing PNET (ORhom\u2009=\u20092.08, 95% CI 1.05-4.11, p\u2009=\u20090.035). This SNP is in linkage disequilibrium with another polymorphic variant associated with increased risk of several cancer types. In silico analysis suggested that the SNP could alter the sequence recognized by the Neuron-Restrictive Silencer Factor (NRSF), whose deregulation has been associated with the development of several tumors. The mechanistic link between the allele and the disease has not been completely clarified yet but the epidemiologic evidences that link the DNA region to increased cancer risk are convincing. In conclusion, our results suggest rs2518719 as a pleiotropic CDKN2A variant associated with the risk of developing PNETs."

Two recently performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on PDAC overall survival (OS) suggested (P < 10(-5)) the association between 30 genomic regions and PDAC OS. With the aim to highlight the true associations within these regions, we analyzed 44 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 30 candidate regions in 1722 PDAC patients within the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) consortium. We observed statistically significant associations for five of the selected regions. One association in the CTNNA2 gene on chromosome 2p12 [rs1567532, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19-2.58, P = 0.005 for homozygotes for the minor allele] and one in the last intron of the RUNX2 gene on chromosome 6p21 (rs12209785, HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.98, P = 0.014 for heterozygotes) are of particular relevance. These loci do not coincide with those that showed the strongest associations in the previous GWAS. In silico analysis strongly suggested a possible mechanistic link between these two SNPs and pancreatic cancer survival. Functional studies are warranted to confirm the link between these genes (or other genes mapping in those regions) and PDAC prognosis in order to understand whether these variants may have the potential to impact treatment decisions and design of clinical trials."

Materials and Methods A total of 2813 patients with 4408 nodules (4078 solid, 330 subsolid) were available from the NLST for evaluation. Nodules were scored by using VRC with nine parameters (output was the percentage likelihood of malignancy; VRC threshold for malignancy likelihood set as greater than 5%) and Lung-RADS (output was category 2-4B; malignancy defined as category 4A or 4B; malignancy likelihood greater than 5%). Lung-RADS and VRC were compared for sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for malignancy on a per-nodule and per-patient basis. Results Of 4408 total nodules, 100 of 4078 (2.5%) solid nodules were malignant and 10 of 330 (3%) subsolid nodules were malignant. On an overall per-nodule basis, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for VRC and Lung-RADS were 93%, 90%, and 90% for VRC and 87%, 83%, and 83% for Lung-RADS, respectively (P = .077, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). On a per-patient basis, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for VRC and Lung-RADS were 93%, 85%, and 85% for VRC and 87%, 76%, and 76% for Lung-RADS, respectively (P = .077, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). Conclusion The Vancouver risk calculator had superior overall accuracy than the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System in predicting malignancy in the National Lung Screening Trial for total nodules, as well as on a per-patient basis. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019 See also the editorial by Black in this issue."

Recent summaries showed a positive association between higher alcohol intake and gastric cancer risk, but the magnitude of association is small, there is moderate heterogeneity among studies, and most cases were from Asian populations. We prospectively investigated the associations of alcohol consumption with gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) and gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma (GNCA) in 490,605 adults, aged 50-71 years at baseline who participated in the NIH-AARP diet and health study. Alcohol consumption in the past year was assessed at baseline by questionnaire and defined as total grams of ethanol intake per day or as a categorical variable: nondrinker, up to or including one drink per day, one to three drinks per day and greater than three drinks per day. We used multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between alcohol intake and risk of gastric adenocarcinomas. Through 2011, 662 incident cases of GCA and 713 of GNCA occurred. We found no association between higher alcohol consumption and GCA or GNCA, when examined as total alcoholic beverage intake or individual beverage types of beer, wine and liquor. Furthermore, we observed no association by stratum of sex, ethnic group, educational level or smoking status. We did, however, observe lower risk of GNCA among participants who drank up to one drink per day (HR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67-0.97) compared to nondrinkers. In conclusion, alcohol consumption was not associated with increased risk of GCA or GNCA in this large U.S. cohort."

The purpose of this review was to shed light on this conflict. We conducted a qualitative review in January 2016 to examine sources of variation in sex/gender differences for smoking cessation. We identified 214 sex/gender difference tests from 190 studies through Medline and studies were categorized into efficacy trials (k=37), effectiveness trials (k=77), prospective observational studies of cessation (k=40; current smokers transitioning to former smokers), prospective observational studies of relapse (k=6; former smokers transitioning to current smokers), cross-sectional investigations of former smoker prevalence (k=32), and community-based interventions (k=4). We also summarized evidence across time periods, countries, outcome assessments, study sample, and treatment. Evidence from efficacy and effectiveness trials, as well as prospective observational studies of relapse, demonstrated that women have more difficulty maintaining long-term abstinence than men. Findings from prospective observational studies and cross-sectional investigations were mixed and demonstrated that bio-psycho-social variation in samples across place and time may determine whether or not women or men are less likely to quit smoking. Based on these findings, we consider whether sex/gender differences in quitting meet criteria for a disparity and outline directions for further research."

        "paragraph_text": "von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by mutations in the VHL gene and demonstrates marked phenotypic variability. Genotype-phenotype correlations in Chinese VHL patients have been unclear. To establish genotype-phenotype correlations in Chinese VHL patients, we collected VHL mutations and phenotypes of 291 patients with VHL disease from 115 unrelated families. Genotype-phenotype correlations at mutation type level, mutation region level, and mutation codon level were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models. We found missense mutations conferred an increased risk of pheochromocytoma developments, but a decreased risk of central nervous system hemangioblastomas (CHBs) and pancreatic lesions. Patients with VHL deletions were more prone to developing retinal angiomas. Renal cell carcinomas were more frequent in nonsense, frameshift or splice-site mutations. Mutations in Exon 2 conferred a higher risk and earlier diagnostic age of CHBs than mutations in other exons (HR = 1.684, 95% CI 1.082-2.620, p = 0.021; 27.0 \u00b1 9.7 years versus 32.8 \u00b1 11.7 years, p = 0.024), while patients with mutations in Exon 3 were more prone to developing pheochromocytomas (HR = 2.760, 95% CI 1.419-5.370, p = 0.003). Mutations at codon 80 or codon167 conferred significantly higher risks of pheochromocytomas than other mutations (HR = 4.678, 95% CI 1.392-15.724, p = 0.013; HR = 4.683, 95% CI 2.515-8.719, p < 0.001 respectively). In conclusion, VHL mutation types, mutation regions and mutation codons can act as phenotypic predictors of VHL disease. Mutation regions and mutation codons may aid in directed surveillance and monitoring of VHL patients."

To determine the contribution of mutations in BRCA2 to familial pancreatic cancer, we screened affected probands from 151 high-risk families identified through pancreatic cancer clinics for germ-line BRCA2 mutations. Of these families, 118 had two or more first- and second-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer, and an additional 33 had two or more affected second-degree relatives. The average age of onset for pancreatic cancer was 62.8 years. Five BRCA2 truncating mutations were identified, three in families with two or more first- and second-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer. Three of the families with mutations had a history of breast cancer but not ovarian cancer. Four of five families with mutations were identified through probands with early-onset (<55 years) pancreatic cancer. The results of this study were combined with those from a BRCA2 mutation study of 29 other families from the same Johns Hopkins University National Familial Pancreatic Tumor Registry to estimate the frequency of BRCA2 mutations. A total of 10 carriers from 180 families were identified, suggesting that BRCA2 mutations account for 6% of moderate and high-risk pancreatic cancer families."

Out of all FNMTC cases, only 5% in the syndromic form has well-studied driver germline mutations. These associated syndromes include Cowden syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, Gardner syndrome, Carney complex type 1, Werner syndrome and DICER1 syndrome. It is important for the clinician to recognize these phenotypes so that genetic counseling and testing can be initiated to enable surveillance for associated malignancies and genetic testing of family members. The susceptibility chromosomal loci and genes of 95% of FNMTC cases remain to be characterized. To date, 4 susceptibility genes have been identified (SRGAP1 gene (12q14), TITF-1/NKX2.1 gene (14q13), FOXE1 gene (9q22.33) and HABP2 gene (10q25.3)), out of which only the FOXE1 and the HABP2 genes have been validated by separate study groups. The causal genes located at the other 7 FNMTC-associated chromosomal loci (TCO (19q13.2), fPTC/ PRN (1q21), FTEN (8p23.1-p22), NMTC1 (2q21), MNG1 (14q32), 6q22, 8q24) have yet to be identified. Increasingly, gene regulatory mechanisms (miRNA and enhancer elements) are recognized to affect gene expression and FNMTC tumorigenesis. With newer sequencing technique, along with functional studies, there has been progress in the understanding of the genetic basis of FNMTC. In our review, we summarize the FNMTC studies to date and provide an update on the recently reported susceptibility genes including novel germline SEC23B variant in Cowden syndrome, SRGAP1 gene, FOXE1 gene and HABP2 genes in non-syndromic FNMTC."

However, current data are limited regarding treatment for potential PDAC somatic driver mutations. Although erlotinib is used in PDAC, its use is not targeted based on a\u00a0tumor marker. Many tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeted toward potential driver mutations and critical pathways are in development, including BRAF/MEK, ALK, and CDK4/6. A consensus on screening strategies for individuals at high risk for PDAC is still evolving because of the relatively low prevalence of the disease, the relative invasiveness of endoscopic procedures often used as part of screening, and the lack of a clear survival benefit.",

        "paragraph_text": "PurposePanel-based genetic testing has identified increasing numbers of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who carry germ-line mutations. However, small sample sizes or number of genes evaluated limit prevalence estimates of these mutations. We estimated prevalence of mutations in PDAC patients with positive family history.MethodsWe sequenced 25 cancer susceptibility genes in lymphocyte DNA from 302 PDAC patients in the Mayo Clinic Biospecimen Resource for Pancreatic Research Registry. Kindreds containing at least two first-degree relatives with PDAC met criteria for familial pancreatic cancer (FPC), while the remaining were familial, but not FPC.ResultsThirty-six patients (12%) carried at least one deleterious mutation in one of 11 genes. Of FPC patients, 25/185 (14%) were carriers, while 11/117 (9%) non-FPC patients with family history were carriers. Deleterious mutations (n) identified in PDAC patients were BRCA2 (11), ATM (8), CDKN2A (4), CHEK2 (4), MUTYH/MYH (3 heterozygotes, not biallelic), BRCA1 (2), and 1 each in BARD1, MSH2, NBN, PALB2, and PMS2. Novel mutations were found in ATM, BARD1, and PMS2.ConclusionMultiple susceptibility gene testing in PDAC patients with family history of pancreatic cancer is warranted regardless of FPC status and will inform genetic risk counseling for families."

Risk factors for failure were assessed and outcome measures at presentation were compared to those at last follow-up visit.ResultsTumor control was achieved in 12 (80%) patients in a median follow-up time of 15 months (mean 14, range 8-18). Three patients failed treatment, diagnosed in a median time of 5 months (mean 4, range 3-6), after first PDT. In all failed cases, lesions were 100% pigmented; de novo melanoma rather than transformed nevi and showed a radial growth pattern rather than increased thickness. All failed cases were subsequently successfully treated with radiotherapy. In this cohort, subretinal fluid (SRF) was significantly reduced (P<0.001), vision did not deteriorate (P=0.11) and even improved in patients with subfoveal SRF at presentation (P=0.018), tumor height significantly decreased (P=0.037) and no complications were recorded.ConclusionPrimary PDT was found to be a safe and efficient treatment modality for small pigmented posterior pole choroidal melanoma, achieving short-term tumor control in 80% of patients. PDT offers patients the opportunity to preserve vision by avoiding the retinopathy associated with conventional radiation treatments for choroidal melanoma. However, the long-term local control of these tumors remains uncertain."

        "paragraph_text": "It is important to adequately and timely identify individuals with cancer worries amongst participants in a pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) surveillance program, because they could benefit from psychosocial support to decrease distress. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess both psychosocial and clinical factors associated with cancer worries. High-risk individuals participating in PDAC-surveillance were invited to annually complete a cancer worry scale (CWS) questionnaire which was sent after counseling by the clinical geneticist (T0), after intake for participation in PDAC-surveillance (T1), and then annually after every MRI and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) (T2 and further). Analyses were performed to identify factors associated with cancer worries in the second year of surveillance (T3). We found a significant intra-individual decrease in cancer worries (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.84, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), nevertheless, 33\u00a0% of individuals had a CWS-score \u226514 at T3. We found one factor significantly associated with cancer worries at T3: having a family member affected by PDAC <50\u00a0years of age (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.22, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). The detection of a cystic lesion, a shortened surveillance interval, or undergoing pancreatic surgery did not lead to more cancer worries (P\u00a0=\u00a00.163, P\u00a0=\u00a00.33, and P\u00a0=\u00a00.53, respectively). In conclusion, this study identified 'a family history of PDAC <50\u00a0years of age' as the only predictor of cancer worries experienced after 2\u00a0years of surveillance in individuals at high risk of developing PDAC. This knowledge could help clinicians to timely identify individuals 'at risk' for high levels of cancer worries who would likely benefit from psychosocial support."

Based on the contemporary understanding of the origins and management of ovarian cancer and for simplicity in this document, ovarian cancer also refers to fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal cancer. Clinical genetic testing for gene mutations allows more precise identification of those women who are at an increased risk of inherited breast cancer and ovarian cancer. For these individuals, screening and prevention strategies can be instituted to reduce their risks. Obstetrician-gynecologists play an important role in the identification and management of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. If an obstetrician-gynecologist or other gynecologic care provider does not have the necessary knowledge or expertise in cancer genetics to counsel a patient appropriately, referral to a genetic counselor, gynecologic or medical oncologist, or other genetics specialist should be considered (1). More genes are being discovered that impart varying risks of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and other types of cancer, and new technologies are being developed for genetic testing. This Practice Bulletin focuses on the primary genetic mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, BRCA1 and BRCA2, but also will briefly discuss some of the other genes that have been implicated."

        "paragraph_text": "Daratumumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, is approved as monotherapy and in combination regimens for patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Currently, daratumumab is administered IV. The phase 1b PAVO (MMY1004) study evaluated subcutaneously administered daratumumab in combination with the recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 enzyme (rHuPH20) in patients with relapsed or refractory MM. Part 1 of the study, reported here, evaluated a mix-and-deliver (MD) formulation of daratumumab and rHuPH20 (DARA-MD) administered by subcutaneous infusion. Patients received subcutaneous daratumumab according to the approved IV monotherapy dosing schedule at 1200 mg (n = 8) or 1800 mg (n = 45). Primary end points were safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) variables. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events with DARA-MD 1200 mg were thrombocytopenia, upper respiratory tract infection, insomnia, and decreased appetite (37.5% each). Anemia (33.3%), upper respiratory tract infection, pyrexia, and diarrhea (26.7% each) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse events with DARA-MD 1800 mg. One patient in the 1200-mg dose group (12.5%) and 11 patients in the 1800-mg dose group (24.4%) experienced infusion-related reactions, which were generally grade 1/2 and typically occurred at the first infusion. The 1800 mg dose achieved similar or greater serum concentrations compared with the 16 mg/kg IV dose. Overall response rates of 25.0% and 42.2% were achieved with 1200-mg and 1800-mg DARA-MD, respectively. Subcutaneous administration of DARA-MD was well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory MM, with the 1800-mg dose exhibiting PK concentrations and responses consistent with IV daratumumab in a similar patient population. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02519452."

Obesity can impact hormonal factors, which have been hypothesized to play a role in these cancers. We investigated anthropometric and reproductive factors in relation to esophageal and gastric cancer by subtype and subsite for 476,160 participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox models. During a mean follow-up of 14\u2009years, 220 esophageal adenocarcinomas (EA), 195 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, 243 gastric cardia (GC) and 373 gastric noncardia (GNC) cancers were diagnosed. Body mass index (BMI) was associated with EA in men (BMI \u226530 vs. 18.5-25\u2009kg/m2 : HR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.25-3.03) and women (HR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.15-6.19); however, adjustment for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) attenuated these associations. After mutual adjustment for BMI and HC, respectively, WHR and waist circumference (WC) were associated with EA in men (HR = 3.47, 95% CI: 1.99-6.06 for WHR >0.96 vs. <0.91; HR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.52-4.72 for WC >98 vs. <90\u2009cm) and women (HR = 4.40, 95% CI: 1.35-14.33 for WHR >0.82 vs. <0.76; HR = 5.67, 95% CI: 1.76-18.26 for WC >84 vs. <74\u2009cm). WHR was also positively associated with GC in women, and WC was positively associated with GC in men. Inverse associations were observed between parity and EA (HR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.14-0.99; >2 vs. 0) and age at first pregnancy and GNC (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.32-0.91; >26 vs. <22\u2009years); whereas bilateral ovariectomy was positively associated with GNC (HR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.04-3.36). These findings support a role for hormonal pathways in upper gastrointestinal cancers."

This disease is a consequence of the complex interaction of microbial agents, with environmental and host factors, resulting in the dysregulation of multiple oncogenic and tumor-suppressing signaling pathways. Despite the advances in our understanding of carcinogenesis, there are still reduced therapeutic options for patients with gastric cancer. In recent years, genomic analyses of gastric tumors have emphasized their molecular heterogeneity. The distinction of gastric cancer molecular subtypes may be a key to identify novel therapeutic targets, to predict patient outcome and response to therapy, and to guide early diagnosis strategies. In this review, we summarize the most recent updates on the relationship between microbial agents and gastric cancer, in particular, Helicobacter pylori, the non-H\u00a0pylori microbiome, and Epstein-Barr virus. We also highlight the main advances made in the past year regarding the molecular characterization of gastric cancer, especially the signatures with potential clinical utility."

Research into the identification of mutations in known cancer predisposition genes and through next-generation sequencing has revealed extensive heterogeneity. The development of genetic panel testing has enabled genetic risk assessment and predisposition testing to be routinely offered. Precision oncology has opened the possibility of \"incidental\" germline mutations that may have implications for family members.

We examined the prospective association of individual dietary fatty acids with prostate cancer risk overall, by tumor subtypes, and prostate cancer death. 142,239 men from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition who were free from cancer at recruitment were included. Dietary intakes of individual fatty acids were estimated using center-specific validated dietary questionnaires at baseline and calibrated with 24-h recalls. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). After an average follow-up of 13.9\u2009years, 7,036 prostate cancer cases and 936 prostate cancer deaths were ascertained. Intakes of individual fatty acids were not related to overall prostate cancer risk. There was evidence of heterogeneity in the association of some short chain saturated fatty acids with prostate cancer risk by tumor stage (pheterogeneity <\u20090.015), with a positive association with risk of advanced stage disease for butyric acid (4:0; HR1SD =\u20091.08; 95%CI\u2009=\u20091.01-1.15; p-trend\u2009= 0.026). There were no associations with fatal prostate cancer, with the exception of a slightly higher risk for those who consumed more eicosenoic acid (22:1n-9c; HR1SD =\u20091.05; 1.00-1.11; p-trend\u2009= 0.048) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3c; HR1SD =\u20091.07; 1.00-1.14; p-trend\u2009= 0.045). There was no evidence that dietary intakes of individual fatty acids were associated with overall prostate cancer risk. However, a higher intake of butyric acid might be associated with a higher risk of advanced, whereas intakes of eicosenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids might be positively associated with fatal prostate cancer risk."

Countries following a Mediterranean-type dietary pattern, has been reported to have lower PCa incidence and mortality compared with other European regions. A population-based case-control study has been conducted from January 2015 to December 2016 in a single institution of the municipality of Catania, southern Italy. A total of 118 PCa and 238 population-based controls were collected. Controls had significantly higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet, which was evident for several subgroups (including age groups, overweight and obese men, current smokers, alcohol intake, low and medium physical activity levels). PCa cases were found to consume lower amount of vegetables (223\u2009g/d vs. 261\u2009g/d; p\u2009=\u20090.001), legumes (34.26\u2009g/d vs. 53.55\u2009g/d; p\u2009=\u20090.003), and fish (47.75\u2009g/d vs. 58.3\u2009g/d) than controls; other differences emerged were related to alcohol intake (12.37\u2009g/d vs 5.07\u2009g/d; p\u2009<\u20090.01), cereals (254.06\u2009g/d vs.235.94\u2009g/d; p\u2009<\u20090.001), dairy (196\u2009g/d vs. 166\u2009g/d; p\u2009<\u20090.001), and meat consumption (98.09\u2009g/d vs. 70.15\u2009g/d; p\u2009<\u20090.001). However, no statistically significant differences between cases and controls were found regarding fruit, legumes, and olive oil consumption. The Mediterranean diet score was inversely associated with lower likelihood of having PCa in a linear manner (odds ratio [OR]: 0.86 [95% CI 0.77-0.96]). Specifically, individuals in the highest group of adherence had 78% less likelihood of have PCa and 14% less likelihood for each point increase of the score. The model adjusted for total polyphenol intake showed still a significant inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and PCa, but the relation was no more linear and not significant for one-point increase of the score (OR: 0.88 [95% CI 0.77-1.01]). In our cohorts of Italian men, we observed that high adherence to the Mediterranean diet was inversely associated with likelihood of having PCa cancer."

        "paragraph_text": "Among hereditary colorectal cancer predisposing syndromes, Lynch syndrome (LS) caused by mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2 is the most common. Patients with LS have an increased risk of early onset colon and endometrial cancer, but also other tumors that generally have an earlier onset compared to the general population. However, age at first primary cancer varies within families and genetic anticipation, i.e. decreasing age at onset in successive generations, has been suggested in LS. Anticipation is a well-known phenomenon in e.g neurodegenerative diseases and several reports have studied anticipation in heritable cancer. The purpose of this study is to determine whether anticipation can be shown in a nationwide cohort of Swedish LS families referred to the regional departments of clinical genetics in Lund, Stockholm, Link\u00f6ping, Uppsala and Ume\u00e5 between the years 1990-2013. We analyzed a homogenous group of mutation carriers, utilizing information from both affected and non-affected family members. In total, 239 families with a mismatch repair gene mutation (96 MLH1 families, 90 MSH2 families including one family with an EPCAM-MSH2 deletion, 39 MSH6 families, 12 PMS2 families, and 2 MLH1+PMS2 families) comprising 1028 at-risk carriers were identified among the Swedish LS families, of which 1003 mutation carriers had available follow-up information and could be included in the study. Using a normal random effects model (NREM) we estimate a 2.1 year decrease in age of diagnosis per generation. An alternative analysis using a mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards model (COX-R) estimates a hazard ratio of exp(0.171), or about 1.19, for age of diagnosis between consecutive generations. LS-associated gene-specific anticipation effects are evident for MSH2 (2.6 years/generation for NREM and hazard ratio of 1.33 for COX-R) and PMS2 (7.3 years/generation and hazard ratio of 1.86). The estimated anticipation effects for MLH1 and MSH6 are smaller."

The majority of PPGL tumours are benign and do not recur with distant metastases. However, a sizeable fraction of these tumours secrete vasoactive catecholamines into the circulation causing a variety of symptoms including hypertension, palpitations and diaphoresis. The genetic landscape of PPGL has been well characterized and more than a dozen genes have been described as recurrently mutated. Recent studies of DNA-methylation have revealed distinct clusters of PPGL that share DNA methylation patterns and driver mutations, as well as identified potential biomarkers for malignancy. However, these findings have not been adequately validated in independent cohorts. In this study we use an array-based genome-wide approach to study the methylome of 39 PPGL and 4 normal adrenal medullae. We identified two distinct clusters of tumours characterized by different methylation patterns and different driver mutations. Moreover, we identify genes that are differentially methylated between tumour subcategories, and between tumours and normal tissue."

Two major isoforms, RET9 and RET51, differ in the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal tail as a result of alternative splicing. To determine the roles of these isoforms in vivo, we used targeted mutagenesis to generate mice that express either RET9 or RET51. Monoisoformic RET9 mice, which lack RET51, are viable and appear normal. In contrast, monoisoformic RET51 animals, which lack RET9, have kidney hypodysplasia and lack enteric ganglia from the colon. To study the differential activities of the two RET isoforms further, we generated transgenic mice expressing ligand-dependent and constitutively active forms of RET9 or RET51 under the control of the Hoxb7 regulatory sequences. Such RET9 transgenes are capable of rescuing the kidney agenesis in RET-deficient mice or causing kidney hypodysplasia in wild-type animals. In contrast, similar RET51 transgenes fail to rescue the kidney agenesis or cause hypodysplasia. Our findings show that RET9 and RET51 have different signaling properties in vivo and define specific temporal and spatial requirements of c-Ret function during renal development and histogenesis of the enteric nervous system."

A high genetic risk increases the pretest probability that a biomarker of early cancer is a true positive and warrants further investigation. The highest PDAC risk is generally associated with a hereditary predisposition. However, the majority of PDAC results from complex, progressive gene-environment interactions that currently fall outside the traditional risk models. Over many years, the combination of inflammation, exposure to DNA-damaging toxins, and failed DNA repair promote the accumulation of somatic mutations in pancreatic cells; PDAC risk is further increased by already present oncogenic germline mutations. Predictive models and new technologies are needed to classify patients into more accurate and mechanistic PDAC risk categories that can be linked to improved surveillance and preventative strategies."

        "paragraph_text": "The RET receptor tyrosine kinase mediates cell proliferation, survival and migration in embryogenesis and is implicated in the transformation and tumour progression in multiple cancers. RET is frequently mutated and constitutively activated in familial and sporadic thyroid carcinomas. As a result of alternative splicing, RET is expressed as two protein isoforms, RET9 and RET51, which differ in their unique C-terminal amino acids. These isoforms have distinct intracellular trafficking and associated signalling complexes, but functional differences are not well defined. We used shRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of individual RET isoforms or of total RET to evaluate their functional contributions in thyroid carcinoma cells. We showed that RET is required for cell survival in medullary (MTC) but not papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) cells. In PTC cells, RET depletion reduced cell migration and induced a flattened epithelial-like morphology. RET KD decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers and matrix metalloproteinases and reduced anoikis resistance and invasive potential. Further, we showed that RET51 depletion had significantly greater effects on each of these processes than RET9 depletion in both MTC and PTC cells. Finally, we showed that expression of RET, particularly RET51, was correlated with malignancy in a panel of human thyroid tumour tissues. Together, our data show that RET expression promotes a more mesenchymal phenotype with reduced cell-cell adhesion and increased invasiveness in PTC cell models, but is more important for tumour cell survival, proliferation and anoikis resistance in MTC models. Our data suggest that the RET51 isoform plays a more prominent role in mediating these processes compared to RET9."

The association of CXCL8, CXC Chemokine Receptor 1 (CXCR1), and CXC Chemokine Receptor 2 (CXCR2) polymorphisms with H. pylori infection and gastric cancer progression needs to be investigated in a population within an enigma area consisting of multiple ethnicities, such as Thailand. To analyze the relative risk of H. pylori infection and gastric cancer among Thai gastroduodenal patients, gene polymorphisms in CXCL8 (promoter region -251) and in CXCR1 and CXCR2 (receptors for CXCL8) were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and allele specific-PCR (AS-PCR). We also determined the presence of cytotoxin-associated gene A (cagA) in Thai patients with H. pylori infection. Correlation between the CXCL8 (-251) polymorphism and CXCL8 gene expression was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR). We found a significant association between the T/A and A/A genotypes of CXCL8 (-251) with H.\u00a0pylori infection. However, no significant correlation was found between the CXCR1 (+2607) and CXCR2 (+1208) gene polymorphisms with H. pylori infection among Thai gastroduodenal subjects. Within the H. pylori-infected group of Thai gastroduodenal patients, no significant differences in cagA were observed. In addition, the A/A genotype of CXCL8 (-251) significantly correlated with the risk of gastric cancer and correlated with higher CXCL8 gene expression levels in Thai gastroduodenal patients. These results suggest that CXCL8 (-251) polymorphisms are associated with H. pylori infection, an increased risk of stronger inflammatory responses, and gastric cancer in Thai gastroduodenal patients."

We performed a nationwide survey and obtained histological specimens from 1053 individuals in 19 cities across the country. We examined the gastric mucosa, the topography, the atrophic gastritis risk factors, and the gastric cancer risk scores. Almost half (46.1%) of the patients with dyspeptic symptoms had histological abnormalities; chronic (36.3%) and atrophic gastritis (28.9%) being the most frequent. Individuals of the Timor ethnicity had the highest prevalence of acute (52.6%) and chronic gastritis (68.4%), even those negative for H. pylori. Our topographic analysis showed the majority of patients had predominantly antral acute and chronic gastritis. A multivariate logistic regression model showed age (Odds ratio [OR], 1.107), Timor ethnicity (OR, 8.531), and H. pylori infection (OR, 22.643) as independent risk factors for presence of atrophic gastritis. In addition, the gastric cancer risk score was highest in those from Timor, Papuan, and Bugis ethnic populations. Overall, Indonesia is a low-risk gastric cancer country. However, several ethnic groups displayed severe gastric mucosa symptoms suggesting policy makers should focus on those ethnic groups to perform gastric cancer screenings and to eradicate H. pylori."

Data collection occurred during presystemic treatment/control enrollment and at 12 and 24 months through biospecimens; surveys; self-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function; and neuropsychological tests that measured attention, processing speed, and executive function (APE) and learning and memory (LM). Linear mixed-effects models tested two-way interactions of treatment group (control, chemotherapy with or without hormonal therapy, and hormonal therapy) and time and explored three-way interactions of ApoE (\u03b54+ v not) by group by time; covariates included baseline age, frailty, race, and cognitive reserve.",

These group-by-time differences varied by ApoE genotype, where only \u03b54+ survivors receiving hormone therapy had short-term decreases in adjusted LM scores (three-way interaction P = .03).

Our study aimed at quantifying the association between SEP and gastric cancer (GC) risk through an individual participant data meta-analysis within the \"Stomach cancer Pooling (StoP) Project\". Educational level and household income were used as proxies for the SEP. We estimated pooled odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across levels of education and household income by pooling study-specific ORs through random-effects meta-analytic models. The relative index of inequality (RII) was also computed. A total of 9,773 GC cases and 24,373 controls from 25 studies from Europe, Asia and America were included. The pooled OR for the highest compared to the lowest level of education was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.44-0.84), while the pooled RII was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.29-0.69). A strong inverse association was observed both for noncardia (OR 0.39, 95% CI, 0.22-0.70) and cardia GC (OR 0.47, 95% CI, 0.22-0.99). The relation was stronger among H. pylori negative subjects (RII 0.14, 95% CI, 0.04-0.48) as compared to H. pylori positive ones (RII 0.29, 95% CI, 0.10-0.84), in the absence of a significant interaction (p\u2009=\u20090.28). The highest household income category showed a pooled OR of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.48-0.89), while the corresponding RII was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.22-0.72). Our collaborative pooled-analysis showed a strong inverse relationship between SEP indicators and GC risk. Our data call for public health interventions to reduce GC risk among the more vulnerable groups of the population."

Moreover, 40-60% of patients relapse owing to poor CAR T cell persistence or emergence of CD19- clones. Some factors, including the choice of single-chain spacer6 and extracellular7 and costimulatory domains8, have a profound effect on CAR T cell function and persistence. However, little is known about the impact of CAR binding affinity. There is evidence of a ceiling above which increased immunoreceptor affinity may adversely affect T cell responses9-11. We generated a novel CD19 CAR (CAT) with a lower affinity than FMC63, the high-affinity binder used in many clinical studies1-4. CAT CAR T cells showed increased proliferation and cytotoxicity in vitro and had enhanced proliferative and in vivo antitumor activity compared with FMC63 CAR T cells. In a clinical study (CARPALL, NCT02443831 ), 12/14 patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with CAT CAR T cells achieved molecular remission. Persistence was demonstrated in 11 of 14 patients at last follow-up, with enhanced CAR T cell expansion compared with published data. Toxicity was low, with no severe CRS. One-year overall and event-free survival were 63% and 46%, respectively."

        "paragraph_text": "Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is the most common cause of neonatal intestinal obstruction. It is characterized by the absence of ganglia in the nerve plexuses of the lower gastrointestinal tract. So far, three common disease-susceptibility variants at the RET, SEMA3 and NRG1 loci have been detected through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Europeans and Asians to understand its genetic etiologies. Here we present a trans-ethnic meta-analysis of 507 HSCR cases and 1191 controls, combining all published GWAS results on HSCR to fine-map these loci and narrow down the putatively causal variants to 99% credible sets. We also demonstrate that the effects of RET and NRG1 are universal across European and Asian ancestries. In contrast, we detected a European-specific association of a low-frequency variant, rs80227144, in SEMA3 [odds ratio (OR) = 5.2, P\u2009=\u20094.7 \u00d7 10-10]. Conditional analyses on the lead SNPs revealed a secondary association signal, corresponding to an Asian-specific, low-frequency missense variant encoding RET p.Asp489Asn (rs9282834, conditional OR\u2009=\u200920.3, conditional P\u2009=\u20094.1 \u00d7 10-14). When in trans with the RET intron 1 enhancer risk allele, rs9282834 increases the risk of HSCR from 1.1 to 26.7. Overall, our study provides further insights into the genetic architecture of HSCR and has profound implications for future study designs."

The overall penetrance of pheochromocytoma was 84.6% (11 of 13). Development of medullary thyroid carcinoma in our patients seemed similar to that observed in patients with codon 634 mutations. Haplotype analysis demonstrated that the mutation did not arise from a common ancestor. In vitro studies showed the double C634Y/Y791F RET receptor was significantly more phosphorylated than either activated wild-type receptor or single C634Y and Y791F RET mutants.",

        "paragraph_text": "Selective screening for pancreatic cancer (PC) has been proposed. We describe the establishment of a comprehensive multidisciplinary screening program using 3.0\u00a0T MRI. Criteria for screening included the presence of PC in: \u2265 2 first degree relatives (FDR), 1 FDR and 1\u00a0s degree relative (SDR), \u2265 3 any degree relatives (ADR), or any known hereditary cancer syndrome with increased PC risk. Imaging with 3.0\u00a0T MRI was performed routinely and endoscopic ultrasound was used selectively. Screening was completed in 75 patients (pts). Hereditary cancer syndromes were present in 42 (56%) of the 75 pts: BRCA2 (18), ATM (8), BRCA1 (6), CDKN2A (4), PALB2 (3), Lynch (2), and Peutz-Jeghers (1). A family history of PC was present in \u2265\u20092 FDR in 12 (16%) pts, 1 FDR and 1 SDR in 5 (7) pts, and \u2265\u20093 ADR in 16 (21%) pts. Of the 65 pts who received screening MRI, 28 (43%) pts had pancreatic cystic lesions identified, including 1 (1%) patient in whom a cholangiocarcinoma was diagnosed as well. No patient underwent surgical resection. Using a 3.0\u00a0T MRI to screen patients at high risk for developing PC identified radiographic abnormalities in 43% of patients, which were stable on subsequent surveillance. Specific guidelines for the frequency of surveillance and indications for surgery remain areas of active investigation as the global experience with high risk screening continues to mature."

        "paragraph_text": "Women remain at risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection for most of their lives. The duration of protection against HPV-16/18 from prophylactic vaccination remains unknown. We investigated the 10-year immune response and long-term safety profile of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine) in females aged between 15 and 55\u00a0years at first vaccination. Females who received primary vaccination with three doses of AS04-HPV-16/18 vaccine in the primary phase-III study (NCT00196937) were invited to attend annual evaluations for long-term immunogenicity and safety. Anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies in serum and cervico-vaginal secretions (CVS) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded throughout the follow-up period. Seropositivity rates for anti-HPV-16 remained high (\u226596.3%) in all age groups 10\u00a0years after first vaccination. It was found that 99.2% of 15-25-year olds remained seropositive for anti-HPV-18 compared to 93.7% and 83.8% of 26-45-year olds and 45-55-year olds, respectively. Geometric mean titers (GMT) remained above natural infection levels in all age groups. Anti-HPV-16 and anti-HPV-18 titers were at least 5.3-fold and 3.1-fold higher than titers observed after natural infection, respectively, and were predicted to persist above natural infection levels for \u226530\u00a0years in all age groups. At Year 10, anti-HPV-16/18 antibody titers in subjects aged 15-25\u00a0years remained above plateau levels observed in previous studies. Correlation coefficients for antibody titers in serum and CVS were 0.64 (anti-HPV-16) and 0.38 (anti-HPV-18). This study concluded that vaccinated females aged 15-55\u00a0years elicited sustained immunogenicity with an acceptable safety profile up to 10\u00a0years after primary vaccination, suggesting long-term protection against HPV."

        "paragraph_text": "Acute myeloid leukemias (AML) are characterized by mutations of tumor suppressor and oncogenes, involving distinct genes in adults and children. While certain mutations have been associated with the increased risk of AML relapse, the genomic landscape of primary chemotherapy-resistant AML is not well defined. As part of the TARGET initiative, we performed whole-genome DNA and transcriptome RNA and miRNA sequencing analysis of pediatric AML with failure of induction chemotherapy. We identified at least three genetic groups of patients with induction failure, including those with NUP98 rearrangements, somatic mutations of WT1 in the absence of apparent NUP98 mutations, and additional recurrent variants including those in KMT2C and MLLT10. Comparison of specimens before and after chemotherapy revealed distinct and invariant gene expression programs. While exhibiting overt therapy resistance, these leukemias nonetheless showed diverse forms of clonal evolution upon chemotherapy exposure. This included selection for mutant alleles of FRMD8, DHX32, PIK3R1, SHANK3, MKLN1, as well as persistence of WT1 and TP53 mutant clones, and elimination of FLT3, PTPN11, and NRAS mutant clones. These findings delineate genetic mechanisms of primary chemotherapy resistance in pediatric AML, which should inform improved approaches for its diagnosis and therapy."

The groups were assigned in a 1:4 ratio, with 8061 in the MRI-invitation group and 32,312 in the mammography-only group.

In order to characterize these lymphomas in children from the United States, IRF4 FISH and immunohistochemical stains were performed on 32 follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from Children's Oncology Group studies. Two DLBCLs (6%) had IRF4 rearrangements, one involving the ileocecal valve and another involving the tonsil and cerebrospinal fluid. Both cases had strong, diffuse IRF4/MUM1 immunohistochemical staining, which may be a pathologic clue to the diagnosis. Reclassification of these cases may have prognostic and therapeutic implications."

Thus, the genetic cause that increases the predisposition to colorectal and other related cancers in families with FCCTX remains to be elucidated. Using whole-exome sequencing, we have identified a truncating mutation in the SETD6 gene (c.791_792insA, p.Met264IlefsTer3) in all the affected members of a FCCTX family. SETD6 is a mono-methyltransferase previously shown to modulate the NF-\u03baB and Wnt signaling pathways, among other. In the present study, we characterized the truncated version of SETD6, providing evidence that this SETD6 mutation may play a role in the cancer inheritance in this family. Here we demonstrate that the truncated SETD6 lacks its enzymatic activity as a methyltransferase, while maintaining other properties such as its expression, localization and substrate-binding ability. In addition, we show that the mutant allele is expressed and that the resulting protein competes with the wild type for their substrates, pointing to a dominant negative nature. These findings suggest that the identified mutation impairs the normal function of SETD6, which may result in the deregulation of the different pathways in which it is involved, contributing to the increased susceptibility to cancer in this FCCTX family."

We assessed the global effect of quadrivalent HPV (4vHPV) vaccination on HPV infection and disease. PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for peer-reviewed articles from January 2007 through February 2016 to identify observational studies reporting the impact or effectiveness of 4vHPV vaccination on infection, anogenital warts, and cervical cancer or precancerous lesions. Over the last decade, the impact of HPV vaccination in real-world settings has become increasingly evident, especially among girls vaccinated before HPV exposure in countries with high vaccine uptake. Maximal reductions of approximately 90% for HPV 6/11/16/18 infection, approximately 90% for genital warts, approximately 45% for low-grade cytological cervical abnormalities, and approximately 85% for high-grade histologically proven cervical abnormalities have been reported. The full public health potential of HPV vaccination is not yet realized. HPV-related disease remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality in developing and developed nations, underscoring the need for HPV vaccination programs with high population coverage."

        "paragraph_text": "Although consensus has yet to be reached on universal mismatch-repair (MMR) protein immunohistochemical (IHC) screening for Lynch syndrome (LS) in endometrial cancer (EC), an increasing number of institutions have adopted universal screening protocols similar to those used for colorectal carcinoma. Here we describe our institution's experience with a prospective universal screening protocol in which all ECs resected over a period of 19 months (n=242) were screened for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 deficiencies using IHC, followed by MLH1 promoter methylation testing when appropriate. When consent was obtained, tumor samples underwent next-generation sequencing. A total of 11 unmethylated MMR-deficient cases (4.5% of cohort) were identified through IHC screening. Germline testing was performed in 10 cases and confirmed LS in 4 patients (1.7% of cohort). Of our 4 confirmed LS cases, 1 did not meet traditional LS screening criteria (eg, age below 50 y, Revised Bethesda criteria). In addition, universal screening identified 6 germline-negative MMR-deficient nonmethylated cases, 4 of which occurred in women older than 50. Although our next-generation sequencing data suggest somatic mutations in 4 of these cases, it is possible that these cases may represent cases of \"Lynch-like syndrome.\" We conclude that a subset of LS cases could be missed using traditional screening guidelines. The value of screening for Lynch-like syndrome has yet to be determined. Although the cost-effectiveness of universal screening in EC has yet to be elucidated, we conclude that universal IHC screening is currently a reasonable, and arguably superior, approach to screening for LS."

The main purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of FPC and to define causative FPC-predisposition genes in a Japanese cohort with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).We reviewed 1,197 patients with a pathologically proven PDAC and found that 88 (7.3%) were FPC patients who had at least one first-degree relative with PDAC. There were no significant differences between the FPC cases and sporadic cases in terms of gender, age, tumor location, stage, family history of any cancer except PDAC, and personal history of smoking, other cancers, diabetes mellitus and chronic pancreatitis. In the FPC patients, we then investigated the prevalence of germline mutations in 21 genes associated with hereditary predispositions for pancreatic, breast and ovarian cancers by means of the next-generation sequencing using a custom multiple-gene panel. We found that eight (14.5%) of the 54 FPC patients with available germline DNA carried deleterious mutations in BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, or MLH1. These results indicate that a significant fraction of patients with PDAC in Japan have a family history of pancreatic cancer, and some of them harbor deleterious causative mutations in known FPC predisposition genes."

At 6 years, the CCR and OS rates among 635 nonrandomly treated patients with SR-high disease were 85.55% \u00b1 1.49% and 92.97% \u00b1 1.08%, respectively.",

When we initiated this study with nilotinib, imatinib was the only tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML in chronic phase (CP); alternative treatment options were needed, particularly for patients who developed resistance or intolerance (R/I) to imatinib. This phase 2 study enrolled pediatric patients with either Ph+ CML-CP R/I to imatinib or dasatinib or newly diagnosed Ph+ CML-CP. Data presented are from analyses with minimum follow-up of up to 24 cycles (1 cycle is 28 days). Fifty-nine patients with Ph+ CML-CP were enrolled, and 58 were treated (R/I, n = 33; newly diagnosed, n = 25). Major molecular response (MMR) rate at cycle 6 in the R/I cohort was 39.4% (primary end point); 57.6% of patients achieved or maintained MMR and 81.8% achieved or maintained complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) by 24 cycles. In patients with newly diagnosed disease, rates of MMR by cycle 12 and CCyR at cycle 12 were 64.0% each (primary end points); by cycle 24, cumulative MMR and CCyR rates were 68.0% and 84.0%, respectively. The safety profile of nilotinib in pediatric patients was generally comparable with the known safety profile in adults, although cardiovascular events were not observed in this study, and hepatic laboratory abnormalities were more frequent; no new safety signals were identified. In summary, nilotinib demonstrated efficacy and a manageable safety profile in pediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01844765."

We studied the association between several genitourinary infections and the risk of prostate cancer based on data from the EPICAP study. EPICAP is a population-based case-control study conducted in the d\u00e9partement of H\u00e9rault, France, between 2012 and 2014. A total of 819 incident cases and 879 controls have been face to face interviewed using a standardized questionnaire gathering information on known or suspected risk factors of prostate cancer, and personal history of genitourinary infections: prostatitis, urethritis, orchi-epididymitis, and acute pyelonephritis. Odds Ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence interval were estimated using multivariate unconditional logistic regression. Overall, 139 (18%) cases and 98 (12%) controls reported having at least one personal history of genitourinary infections (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.64 [1.23-2.20]). The risk increased with the number of infections (p-trend\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The association was specifically observed with personal history of chronic prostatitis and acute pyelonephritis (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.95 [1.26-6.92] and OR\u00a0=\u00a02.66 [1.29-5.51], respectively) and in men who did not use any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.00 [1.37-2.91]). Our results reinforce the hypothesis that chronic inflammation, generated by a personal history of genitourinary infections, may play a role in prostate carcinogenesis."

        "paragraph_text": "Purpose Current staging systems for oral cavity cancers incorporate lymph node (LN) size and laterality, but place less weight on the total number of positive metastatic nodes. We investigated the independent impact of numerical metastatic LN burden on survival. Methods Adult patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma undergoing upfront surgical resection for curative intent were identified in the National Cancer Data Base between 2004 and 2013. A neck dissection of a minimum of 10 LNs was required. Multivariable models were constructed to assess the association between the number of metastatic LNs and survival, adjusting for factors such as nodal size, laterality, extranodal extension, margin status, and adjuvant treatment. Results Overall, 14,554 patients met inclusion criteria (7,906 N0 patients; 6,648 node-positive patients). Mortality risk escalated continuously with increasing number of metastatic nodes without plateau, with the effect most pronounced with up to four LNs (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.29 to 1.39; P < .001). Extranodal extension (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.65; P < .001) and lower neck involvement (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.27; P < .001) also predicted increased mortality. Increasing number of nodes examined was associated with improved survival, plateauing at 35 LNs (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.98 to 0.99; P < .001). In multivariable models accounting for the number of metastatic nodes, contralateral LN involvement (N2c status) and LN size were not associated with mortality. A novel nodal staging system derived by recursive partitioning analysis exhibited greater concordance than the American Joint Committee on Cancer (8th edition) system. Conclusion The number of metastatic nodes is a critical predictor of oral cavity cancer mortality, eclipsing other features such as LN size and contralaterality in prognostic value. More robust incorporation of numerical metastatic LN burden may augment staging and better inform adjuvant treatment decisions."

Co-testing of HPV testing and cytology maximized the sensitivity (0.93; 95% CI, 0.87 to 0.96), while HPV genotyping (detection of the same genotype between pre- and posttreatments) did not improve the sensitivity (0.89; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.94) compared with high-risk HPV testing alone.

Here we report highly recurrent hotspot mutations (r.3A>G) of U1 spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in about 50% of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) medulloblastomas. These mutations were not present across other subgroups of medulloblastoma, and we identified these hotspot mutations in U1 snRNA in only <0.1% of 2,442 cancers, across 36 other tumour types. The mutations occur in 97% of adults (subtype SHH\u03b4) and 25% of adolescents (subtype SHH\u03b1) with SHH medulloblastoma, but are largely absent from SHH medulloblastoma in infants. The U1 snRNA mutations occur in the 5' splice-site binding region, and snRNA-mutant tumours have significantly disrupted RNA splicing and an excess of 5' cryptic splicing events. Alternative splicing mediated by mutant U1 snRNA inactivates tumour-suppressor genes (PTCH1) and activates oncogenes (GLI2 and CCND2), and represents a target for therapy. These U1 snRNA mutations provide an example of highly recurrent and tissue-specific mutations of a non-protein-coding gene in cancer."

        "paragraph_text": "Cancers are caused by genomic alterations known as drivers. Hundreds of drivers in coding genes are known but, to date, only a handful of noncoding drivers have been discovered-despite intensive searching1,2. Attention has recently shifted to the role of altered RNA splicing in cancer; driver mutations that lead to transcriptome-wide aberrant splicing have been identified in multiple types of cancer, although these mutations have only been found in protein-coding splicing factors such as splicing factor\u00a03b subunit\u00a01 (SF3B1)3-6. By contrast, cancer-related alterations in the noncoding component of the spliceosome-a series of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)-have barely been studied, owing to the combined challenges of characterizing noncoding cancer drivers and the repetitive nature of snRNA genes1,7,8. Here we report a highly recurrent A>C somatic mutation at the third base of U1 snRNA in several types of tumour. The primary function of U1 snRNA is to recognize the 5'\u00a0splice site via base-pairing. This mutation changes the preferential A-U base-pairing between U1 snRNA and the 5'\u00a0splice site to C-G base-pairing, and thus creates novel splice junctions and alters the splicing pattern of multiple genes-including known drivers of cancer. Clinically, the A>C mutation is associated with heavy alcohol use in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and with the aggressive subtype of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable regions. The mutation in U1 snRNA also independently confers an adverse prognosis to patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Our study demonstrates a noncoding driver in spliceosomal RNAs, reveals a mechanism of aberrant splicing in cancer and may represent a new target for treatment. Our findings also suggest that driver discovery should be extended to a wider range of genomic regions."

Incidence decreased significantly with vitamin supplementation but not with garlic supplementation (0.64, 0.46 to 0.91 and 0.81, 0.57 to 1.13, respectively). All three interventions showed significant reductions in gastric cancer mortality: fully adjusted hazard ratio for H pylori treatment was 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.99), for vitamin supplementation was 0.48 (0.31 to 0.75), and for garlic supplementation was 0.66 (0.43 to 1.00).

The procedures should be started without delay and the co-operation between the primary and tertiary medical centers is highly desirable.

Representing the European Registry of Hereditary Pancreatitis and Familial Pancreatic Cancer (EUROPAC) and the German National Case Collection for Familial Pancreatic Cancer (FaPaCa), we evaluated whether truncating mutations could also be detected in European FPC families. We have directly sequenced the 13 exons of the PALB2 gene in affected index patients of 81 FPC families. An index patient was defined as the first medically identified patient, stimulating investigation of other members of the family to discover a possible genetic factor. None of these patients carried a BRCA2 mutation. We identified three (3.7%) truncating PALB2 mutations, each producing different stop codons: R414X, 508-9delAG and 3116delA. Interestingly, each of these three families also had a history of breast cancer. Therefore, PALB2 mutations might be causative for FPC in a small subset of European families, especially in those with an additional occurrence of breast cancer."

The workshop brought together diverse stakeholders (patients, advocates, academicians, clinicians, research funders, and policymakers) to review progress and ongoing challenges since the Institute of Medicine (IOM)'s seminal report on the subject of adult cancer survivors published in 2006. This commentary profiles the content of the meeting sessions and concludes with recommendations that stem from the workshop discussions. Although there has been progress over the past decade, many of the recommendations from the 2006 report have not been fully implemented. Obstacles related to the routine delivery of standardized physical and psychosocial care services to cancer survivors are substantial, with important gaps in care for patients and caregivers. Innovative care models for cancer survivors have emerged, and changes in accreditation requirements such as the Commission on Cancer's (CoC) requirement for survivorship care planning have put cancer survivorship on the radar. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation's Oncology Care Model (OCM), which requires psychosocial services and the creation of survivorship care plans for its beneficiary participants, has placed increased emphasis on this service. The OCM, in conjunction with the CoC requirement, is encouraging electronic health record vendors to incorporate survivorship care planning functionality into updated versions of their products. As new models of care emerge, coordination and communication among survivors and their clinicians will be required to implement patient- and community-centered strategies."

Spontaneous pneumothorax was the presenting manifestation that led to the diagnosis of BHD in 65% of patients, typically after the second episode (mean, 2.4 episodes). Seventy-nine (76%) of 104 patients had at least one spontaneous pneumothorax during their lifetime, and 82% had multiple pneumothoraces. Among patients with multiple pneumothoraces, 73% had an ipsilateral recurrence, and 48% had a subsequent contralateral spontaneous pneumothorax following a sentinel event. The mean ages at first and second pneumothoraces were 36.5 years (range, 14-63 yr) and 37 years (range, 20-55 yr), respectively. The average number of spontaneous pneumothoraces experienced by patients with a sentinel pneumothorax was 3.6. Pleurodesis was generally performed after the second (mean, 2.4) ipsilateral pneumothorax and reduced the ipsilateral recurrence rate by half. A total of 11 episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax occurred among eight patients either during or within the 24-hour period following air travel, consistent with an air travel-related pneumothorax rate of 8% per patient and 0.12% per flight.

Accumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER makes cells undergo a stress response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR is initially protective. However, prolonged and severe ER stress can lead to autophagy and/or the induction of apoptosis in stressed cell. Many studies have demonstrated that ER stress and the UPR are involved in different diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, and inflammatory diseases. Curcumin, a natural polyphenol, has well documented evidence supporting its numerous biological properties including antioxidant, anti-in\ufb02ammatory, immune-modulatory, anti-microbial, anti-ischemic, anti-angiogenesis, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, anti-atherogenic and anti-diabetic activities. In this review, the role of ER stress in several pathological condition and the potential protective effects of curcumin are discussed."

Emerging evidence suggests that aloe-emodin exhibits many pharmacological effects, including anticancer, antivirus, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiparasitic, neuroprotective, and hepatoprotective activities. These pharmacological properties lay the foundation for the treatment of various diseases, including influenza virus, inflammation, sepsis, Alzheimer's disease, glaucoma, malaria, liver fibrosis, psoriasis, Type 2 diabetes, growth disorders, and several types of cancers. However, an increasing number of published studies have reported adverse effects of aloe-emodin. The primary toxicity among these reports is hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, which are of wide concern worldwide. Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that aloe-emodin has a poor intestinal absorption, short elimination half-life, and low bioavailability. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the pharmacology, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of aloe-emodin reported to date with an emphasis on its biological properties and mechanisms of action."

This study evaluated antiproliferative activity and cancer cell selectivity of a curcumin derivative, curcumin nicotinate (CN), in which two niacin molecules were introduced. Our data showed that CN effectively inhibited proliferation and clonogenic growth of colon (HCT116), breast (MCF-7) and nasopharyngeal (CNE2, 5-8F and 6-10B) cancer cells with IC50 at 27.7 \u03bcM, 73.4 \u03bcM, 64.7 \u03bcM, 46.3 \u03bcM, and 31.2 \u03bcM, respectively. In cancer cells, CN induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase through a p53-mediated mechanism, where p53 was activated, p21 and pro-apoptotic proteins Bid and Bak were upregulated, and PARP was cleaved. In non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells MCF10A, CN at 50 \u00b5M had no cytotoxicity and p53 was not activated, but curcumin at 12.5 \u00b5M activated p53 and p21 and inhibited MCF10A cell growth. These data suggest that CN inhibits cell growth and proliferation through p53-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest with cancer cell selectivity."

Traditional Chinese medicines have been widely employed to treat various types of cancer in China. This investigation aims to determine the association between Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) therapy and survival outcomes in CRC patients with liver-limited metastases. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed among patients with colorectal liver metastases at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine in Guangzhou, China. Data from a series of consecutive patients were collected via an electronic medical record system or telephone follow-up. We defined high exposure as a period of CHM therapy lasting more than 6 months. The primary outcome was overall survival. Results: The study included the data of 191 patients from January 2008 to December 2017; 126 patients (65.97%) met the inclusion criteria of high exposure to CHM. Multivariate analyses revealed that high exposure to CHM was associated with better overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.444, 95% confidence interval = [0.213, 0.926], P = .030). The association was further confirmed by a subgroup exploratory analysis. Conclusion: Long-term CHM therapy is correlated with improved survival outcomes in CRC patients with liver-limited metastases."

From searches on Google Scholar, PubMed, and Web of Science databases, studies were identified involving TCMs with P. americana, which have a history of use over several thousand years, and demonstrate how extracts from this insect play a role in the treatment of diseases through antibacterial, antiviral, antitumor activity, and enhancement of immune function. Extracts from P. americana have not been fully developed for clinical use because the active components have not been completely purified or their molecular mechanisms thoroughly understood. The development of extraction technology in modern Chinese medicine has revealed that many extracts from P. americana are able to play an important role in the control of diseases such as cancer. Drugs such as 'Kangfuxin Solution' and 'Xinmailong Injection' are now widely used for gastrointestinal ulcers and chronic heart failure, having achieved beneficial curative effects in clinical studies. Based on this, the information from studies of P. americana in TCM and modern medicine should be combined and their respective advantages applied. This review provides an overview of the role of P. americana in modern and TCM and thus contributes to identification of further applications and area requiring drug development."

Of these, compound 1 was previously identified in the seeds of L. sativum. Exposure to the alkaloid extract caused death of Jurkat E6-1 cells, with median lethal concentration (LC50) of 75.25\u202f\u00b5g/mL. However, the alkaloid extract also showed a nontoxic and proliferative (1.6-fold) effect in healthy PBMCs. Further experiments performed with Jurkat cells at LC50 and sub-LC50 doses demonstrated DNA fragmentation, activation of caspase-3 and time-dependant phosphatidylserine translocation (apoptosis) from inner to outer cell membranes. Cell toxicity and assessment of adenosine triphosphate level, together with using qPCR to evaluate expression profile of major apoptosis genes, revealed that apoptosis may be induced by disruption in the mitochondrial outer membrane potential, through activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways in Jurkat cells.",

Salvianolic acid A & B have been reported to owe anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective activities. Currently salvianolic acids have been emerged as potent anti-cancer molecules. Salvianolic acid A & B fight cancer progression by prompting apoptosis, halting cell cycle and adjourning metastasis by targeting multiple deregulated signaling networks of cancer. Moreover, salvianolic acid A & B display potency towards sensitizing cancer cells to chemo-drugs. The review purposes that salvianolic acid A & B supply a novel opportunity for drug discovery but further experimentation is mandatory to embellish the knowledge of their pharmacological usage and to access their toxicological limits in order to establish these compounds as potential multitarget future drugs."

SIN can be used as a tumor cell killer and an adjuvant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, recent studies are mostly limited to the basic experimental stage; no systematic clinical studies have yet been reported. Therefore, this paper aimed to review the mechanism underlying the antitumor effects of SIN by consulting relevant domestic and foreign studies and to provide a relevant reference for further development, use, and exploration of SIN."

Noni fruit has come from the Morinda citrifolia tree which is called Rubiaceae, and it is from the coffee family. It is a perennial herb whose ripe fruit has a robust butyric acid smell and flavor. Recently scientists have proven that this fruit has antioxidant and antibiotic properties in vitro. An anthraquinone, damnacanthal, is one of the constituents of Morinda citrifolia. It has been demonstrated to have anti-cancer properties. Damnacanthal has low water solubility and low bioavailability. Formulating of damnacanthal into the biodegradable nanocapsule drug delivery system may increase its bioavailability. Various formulations of damnacanthal would be developed to enable the selection of a dosage form that could offer the provision of the anti-cancer bioactive substance with suitable sustained- or controlled release properties. The efficiency of extraction of damnacanthal will be compared using both conventional and traditional method. Both the damnacanthal and an anthraquinone active compounds extracted from noni roots, are currently being studied in the context of anti-cancer study. Soon, the medical values, bioactivities and nutritional of this fruit can be assessed, especially its anti-cancer activity, this fruit extract could play an outstanding economic role in Malaysia and other tropical countries."

Numerous studies have shown that ginsenosides have direct function in tumor cells through the induction of cancer cell apoptosis and the inhibition of cancer cell growth and enhance the antitumor immunity through the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. However, little is known about the function of ginsenosides on myeloid immunosuppressive cells including dendritic cells in tumor, tumor-associated macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironments. Those myeloid immunosuppressive cells play important roles in promoting tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. In the review, we summarize the regulatory functions of ginsenosides on myeloid immunosuppressive cells in tumor microenvironment, providing the novel therapeutic methods for clinical cancer treatment."

However, the long-term survival rate of patients with osteosarcoma is low due to a high risk of metastasis. Hence, a new approach is urgently needed to improve the treatment of osteosarcoma. Compared with chemotherapy, natural active constituents isolated from herbs exhibit less adverse effects and better anti-tumor effects. This study aimed to summarize the anticancer effects of constituents of herbs on the progression and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells. It showed that many constituents of herbs inhibited osteosarcoma by targeting proliferation, matrix metalloproteinases, integrin and cadherin, and angiogenesis. The findings might be beneficial for the development of new drugs and treatment strategies."

        "paragraph_text": "This vignette based study aimed to examine recommendations of health care professionals (HCPs) in promoting self-management strategies to cancer patients. Nine-hundred-forty-two physicians and nurses were asked to (1) indicate if they would recommend self-management strategies to a vignette cancer patient, and (2) to specify those in an open format. Vignettes included a manipulation of patient age (60 vs. 75\u00a0years) and treatment phase (currently treated versus treatment completed). Six categories emerged through coding a total of 2303 recommendations: physical activity (71.8%), nutrition (64.3%), psychological support (36.7%), medical support (29.2%), conscious living (17.2%) and naturopathy (12.3%). While psychological support was particularly recommended during treatment, physical activity was more frequently recommended after completion of treatment. Results suggest that HCPs recommend a variety of self-management strategies besides standard medical treatment. Patient's treatment phase and age seem to partly influence recommendation behavior, potentially indicating insecurities regarding acute treatment situations and age-related stereotypes."

Symptoms of functional dyspepsia include postprandial fullness, early satiety, and epigastric pain or burning. Functional dyspepsia is a diagnosis of exclusion; therefore, evaluation for a more serious disease such as an upper gastrointestinal malignancy is warranted. Individual alarm symptoms do not correlate with malignancy for patients younger than 60 years, and endoscopy is not necessarily warranted but should be considered for patients with severe or multiple alarm symptoms. For patients younger than 60 years, a test and treat strategy for Helicobacter pylori is recommended before acid suppression therapy. For patients 60 years or older, upper endoscopy should be performed. All patients should be advised to limit foods associated with increased symptoms of dyspepsia; a diet low in FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols) is suggested. Eight weeks of acid suppression therapy is recommended for patients who test negative for H. pylori, or who continue to have symptoms after H. pylori eradication. If acid suppression does not alleviate symptoms, patients should be treated with tricyclic antidepressants followed by prokinetics and psychological therapy. The routine use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies has not shown evidence of effectiveness and is not recommended."

Here, we proposed the protocol for rational design of drug combination with poly-pharmacological effects by integration of design of experiments (DOE), computational modeling, and multiple-objective optimization algorithm. Here, we introduce a common workflow for modeling quantitative relationship of chemical composition and multiple activities of drug combinations. As an example, anti-oxidation, neuroprotective, and anti-platelet activities of three different salvia polyphenols were measured, which were mathematically represented by multivariant regression models to evaluate the effect of combination. In validation, the optimized combination which obtained by weighed-sum method showed good activities in all three models. Our results demonstrate that the multiple-objective optimization strategy is suitable to optimize the ratio of the compounds so to induce the best therapeutic action."

This overview focuses on the anticancer properties of UA against breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) that are most common among women and men, respectively. In vitro studies have shown that UA inhibited the growth of BC and CRC cell lines through various molecular targets and signaling pathways. There are several in vivo studies on the cytotoxic activity of UA against BC and CRC. UA also inhibits the growth of other types of cancer. Studies on structural modifications of UA have shown that the -OH groups at C3 and at C28 are critical factors influencing the cytotoxic activity of UA and its derivatives. Some needs for future research are suggested. Sources of information were from ScienceDirect, Google Scholar and PubMed."

Adequate screening may prevent of a second cancer and incident cancers in family members via risk-reducing strategies. The goal of the study was to evaluate the detection rate of Lynch syndrome via a targeted screening approach. In 2009, we incorporated targeted Lynch syndrome screening via immunohistochemistry for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6, followed by MLH1 promoter hypermethylation, in select cases of endometrial carcinoma. Criteria for patient selection included (1) all patients <50 years; (2) patients of any age with tumors showing features of microsatellite instability (lower uterine segment-centered tumors, hard to classify carcinomas, increased peritumoral or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and cases with synchronous ovarian carcinomas); (3) clinician's request based on family or personal history; and (4) ad hoc retrospective testing based on the established criteria on patients discovered on follow-up visits. By using a targeted screening approach in a 4.5-year period, approximately 2.1% of endometrial cancers (7 of 328) were potentially associated with Lynch syndrome. Therefore, targeted screening with combined age and morphology based criteria enriches detection of Lynch syndrome in endometrial cancer. However, the detection rate is lower than the rates from published series that offer universal screening."

Additionally, in vitro 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay against MCF-7, HCT-116, HepG-2 and non-cancerous MRC-5 cell lines was performed to determine their selective anti-cancer activity. The Aca-Ch fraction exhibited remarkable cytotoxic activity against all tested cancerous cell lines with IC50 4.81- 12.2\u03bcg/mL, while both Aca-Ch and Aca-H fractions possessed potent cytotoxic activities on HCT-116 (IC50 4.81 and 10.1, respectively) with negligible harm but selective effect on non-cancerous MRC-5 cells (IC50 20.4 and 85.2, respectively)."

In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which SF inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. A new compound, kushenol Z (KZ), and 14 known flavonoids were isolated from SF. KZ, sophoraflavanone G, and kushenol A demonstrated potent cytotoxicity against NSCLC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner; KZ showed a wide therapeutic window. We also found that KZ induced NSCLC cell apoptosis by increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and by activating caspase-3 and caspase-9 leading to mitochondrial apoptosis, and upregulated CHOP and activatedcaspase-7 and caspase-12, which triggered the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway. After KZ treatment, we observed cAMP accumulation, which reflected the inhibition of cAMP-phosphodiesterase (PDE), along with the increase in PKA activity; additionally, phospho-p70 S6 kinase was downregulated. KZ also attenuated the phosphorylation of Akt and PRAS40, which was partially rescued by an Akt activator. This suggested that KZ mediated the antiproliferative activity in NSCLC cells by inhibiting the mTOR pathway through the inhibition of cAMP-PDE and Akt. These findings suggested that KZ may be used as a promising cAMP-PDE and Akt inhibitor in targeted chemotherapeutic drug development."

        "paragraph_text": "Objective. To compare the effects of a group-mediated cognitive behavioral (GMCB) exercise and dietary (EX+D) intervention with those of standard-of-care (SC) treatment on select social cognitive outcomes in prostate cancer (PCa) patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Methods. In the single-blind, 2-arm, randomized controlled Individualized Diet and Exercise Adherence-Pilot (IDEA-P) trial, 32 PCa patients (mean age = 66.2 years; SD = 7.8) undergoing ADT were randomly assigned to a 12-week EX+D intervention (n = 16) or SC treatment (n = 16). The exercise component of the personalized EX+D intervention integrated a combination of supervised resistance and aerobic exercise performed twice per week. The dietary component involved counseling and education to modify dietary intake and composition. Blinded assessments of social cognitive outcomes were obtained at baseline and 2-month and 3-month follow-up. Results. Intent-to-treat analysis of covariance demonstrated that the EX+D intervention resulted in significantly greater improvements in scheduling (P < .05), coping (P < .01), and exercise self-efficacy (P < .05), and satisfaction with function (P < .01) at 3 months relative to SC. Results of partial correlation analysis also demonstrated that select social cognitive outcomes were significantly correlated with primary trial outcomes of mobility performance and exercise participation (P < .05) at 3-month follow-up. Conclusions: The GMCB lifestyle intervention yielded more favorable improvements in relevant social cognitive outcomes relative to SC among PCa patients undergoing ADT. Additionally, more favorable social cognitive outcomes were associated with superior mobility performance and exercise participation following the independent maintenance phase of the EX+D intervention."

She was followed up for 1 year and 5 months after completion of initial treatment for peritoneal cancer (preoperative chemotherapy + optimal surgery + chemotherapy). A gradual increase in the tumor marker CA125 occurred, and computed tomography and ultrasonography showed bilateral neck, left supraclavicular and right axillary lymphadenopathy. The patient wanted to continue her job. Therefore, she was treated with etoposide (25 mg) daily for 3 weeks and TJ-48 (juzen-taihoto, 7.5 g) daily for 4 weeks, and then followed up. After two weeks, swelling of lymph nodes had been reduced or eliminated and tumor marker CA125 was negative. The only adverse reaction was slight numbness and the patient continued to work while receiving the same drugs orally for 2 years and 8 months without any symptoms or recurrence. This case shows that a combination of etoposide and TJ-48 has an antitumor effect on recurrent progressive peritoneal cancer while allowing a patient to work and have a normal daily life."

        "paragraph_text": "The current study explored the basic molecular mechanisms of zerumbone (ZER), an herbal compound, in inhibiting the migration and invasion of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells in vitro. Two types of CRC cells, namely HCT-116 and SW48, were treated with various concentrations of ZER (8, 16, and 24\u2009\u00b5M) for 24, 48, and 72\u2009h, respectively. In vitro assays were performed to determine alterations in proliferation ability, mRNA expression and protein levels, and migration and invasion potential of CRC cells. An SYBR Green-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to detect the gene expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) followed by the evaluation of the level of proteins by western blotting. Migration and invasion potentials of HCT-116 and SW48 cells treated by ZER were examined using migration and invasion assay kits, respectively. We compared the results of all experiments with control groups, including FAK inhibitor, ZER\u2009+\u2009FAK inhibitor-treated cells, NF-\u03b2 inhibitor, ZER\u2009+\u2009NF-\u03b2 inhibitor, and untreated cells. The data in the present study suggest that ZER may exert its antimetastatic effects through inhibition of FAk/PI3k/NF-\u03baB-uPA signaling pathway, thereby possibly representing a novel class of FAK inhibitors."

For this, an up-to-date (from 1991 to October 2018) search was done on the databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, The American Chemical Society, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Google Scholar databases. The findings suggest that agathisflavone possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antiparasitic, cytotoxic, neuroprotective, and hepatoprotective activities. An in silico study of agathisflavone against 17 essential proteins/enzymes revealed that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 are the most efficient enzymes for the interaction and binding of this biflavonoid for its anti-inflammatory activity. In conclusion, agathisflavone may be one of the promising plant-derived lead compounds in the treatment of oxidative stress, inflammatory diseases, microbial infection, hepatic and neurological diseases and disorders, and cancer. \u00a9 2019 IUBMB Life, 71(9):1192-1200, 2019."

Their structures were elucidated as (16\u03b1)-16,17-dihydroxy-ent-kauran-2-one17-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (1), (16R) -16,17-dihydroxy-ent-kaurane-2-one (2), 3,3'-di-O-methylellagic acid 4-(5''-acetyl)-\u03b1-L-arabinofuranoside (3), quercilicoside A (4), esculetine (5) and ethyl-\u03b2-D-glucoside (6). All the compounds were isolated from Rubus Chingji Hu for the first time. Compounds 3 and 5 shown distinctive free radical scavenging activities in DPPH and FRAP assays. In addition, no cytotoxicity was observed for compounds 3 and 5 against different cancer cells, suggesting that they might be useful as potential antioxidant agents against various reactive oxygen species.[Formula: see text]."

The structures of all the compounds were determined using spectrometric and spectroscopic methods including 1D and 2D NMR, and HRSEIMS. The identities of the known compounds were further confirmed by comparison of their data with those reported in the literature. The root and bark methanolic extracts, the dichloromethane and ethyl acetate soluble fractions, and the isolated compounds (3-13), were assessed for their cytotoxicity against the cancer cell lines A-549, MCF-7, and PC-3. The results suggested that compounds in the extracts might possess a synergic action in their cytotoxicity."

        "paragraph_text": "We reported in our previously executed studies that the fermented culture broth of Antrodia salmonea (AS), a mushroom used in Taiwanese folk medicine induced reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated apoptosis in human ovarian carcinoma cells. In this study, we studied the anticancer efficacies of AS (0-240\u2009\u03bcg/ml) by examining the key molecular events implicated in cell death associated with autophagy in SKOV-3 and A2780 human ovarian carcinoma cells and clarified the fundamental molecular mechanisms. Treatment of ovarian carcinoma cells with AS-induced autophagic cell death mediated by increased microtubule-associated protein LC3-II, GFP-LC3 puncta, and acidic vesicular organelle (AVO) formation. These events are linked with the activation of p62/SQSTM1, the inhibition of ATG4B, the expression of ATG7, and the dysregulation of Beclin-1/Bcl-2 (i.e., B-cell lymphoma 2). N-acetylcysteine inhibited AS-induced ROS generation, which in turn constricted AS-induced LC3 conversion, AVO formation, and ATG4B inhibition, indicating ROS-mediated autophagy cell death. In addition, the 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or chloroquine (CQ)-induced autophagy inhibition decreased AS-induced apoptosis. Additionally, apoptosis inhibition by Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, substantially suppressed AS-induced autophagy. Furthermore, AS-inhibited HER-2/ neu and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways which were reversed by autophagy inhibitors 3-MA and CQ. Thus, A. salmonea is a potential chemopreventive agent that is capable of activating ROS-mediated autophagic cell death in ovarian carcinoma cells."

        "paragraph_text": "Glioma, especially its most malignant type, Glioblastoma (GBM), is the most common and the most aggressive malignant tumour in the central nervous system. Currently, we have no specific therapies that can significantly improve its dismal prognosis. Recent studies have reported promising in vitro experimental results of several novel glioma-targeting drugs; these studies are encouraging to both researchers and patients. However, clinical trials have revealed that novel compounds that focus on a single, clear glioma genetic alteration may not achieve a satisfactory outcome or have side effects that are unbearable. Based on this consensus, phytochemicals that exhibit multiple bioactivities have recently attracted much attention. Traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Indian medicine (Ayurveda) have shown that phytocompounds inhibit glioma angiogenesis, cancer stem cells and tumour proliferation; these results suggest a novel drug therapeutic strategy. However, single phytocompounds or their direct usage may not reverse comprehensive malignancy due to poor histological penetrability or relatively unsatisfactory in vivo efficiency. Recent research that has employed temozolomide combination treatment and Nanoparticles (NPs) with phytocompounds has revealed a powerful dual-target therapy and a high blood-brain barrier penetrability, which is accompanied by low side effects and strong specific targeting. This review is focused on major phytocompounds that have contributed to glioma-targeting treatment in recent years and their role in drug resistance inhibition, as well as novel drug delivery systems for clinical strategies. Lastly, we summarize a possible research strategy for the future."

Most spiritual interventions carried out in Iranian research are based on care and support models that have been developed in the West. With the unique cultural and religious features of the Iranian context, a more refined look at spiritual care in the hospital care system of Iran is called for. This paper examines how to implement the spiritual care of cancer patients in hospitals and oncology wards in Iran. A consensus panel of experts was used to develop guidelines for spiritually integrated care consisting of 18 primary areas, which are described in detail in this report. Health care policy makers and managers of health care in Iran and possibly other areas of the Middle East should consider implementing these guidelines. Using indigenous models and programs specific to the religion and the cultural of a region should be considered when providing spiritual care for cancer patients."

We examined the enhancing effect of ATP depletion on anti-cancer actions of tetrandrine (TET) in human lung carcinoma A549 cells. A 24-h incubation of A549 cells with tetrandrine caused a concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect (LC50\u2009=\u200966.1\u00a0\u03bcM). Co-incubation with 20\u00a0mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, glycolysis inhibitor) caused only a very slight enhancement of tetrandrine cytotoxicity. By contrast, inhibiting mitochondrial ATP production with oligomycin (10\u00a0\u03bcM, ATP synthase inhibitor) and FCCP (30\u00a0\u03bcM, uncoupling agent) (thus, oligo-FCCP) on its own caused only slight cell cytotoxicity but strongly potentiated tetrandrine cytotoxicity (tetrandrine LC50\u2009=\u200915.6\u00a0\u03bcM). The stronger enhancing effect of oligo-FCCP than 2-DG on TET toxicity did not result from more severe overall ATP depletion, since both treatments caused a similar ATP level suppression. Neither oligo-FCCP nor 2-DG synergized with tetrandrine in decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential. TET on its own triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and oligo-FCCP, but not 2-DG, potentiated TET in causing ROS production. Taken together, our results suggest that inhibiting ATP production from mitochondria, but not from glycolysis, appears to be a very effective means in augmenting TET-triggered ROS production and hence toxicity in A549 cells."

Cardamonin, a chalconoid present in several plants has been known for a longtime to have beneficial properties towards human health. In this review, we aimed to highlight the recent advances achieved in discovering the pharmacological properties of cardamonin. Cardamonin is cardamom-derived chalcone, which plays a role in cancer treatment, immune system modulation, inflammation and pathogens killing. Through the modulation of cellular signaling pathways, cardamonin activates cell death signal to induce apoptosis in malignant cells that results in the inhibition of cancer development. Moreover, cardamonin arrests cell cycle by altering the expression of regulatory proteins during malignant cells division. Due to its relatively selective cytotoxic potential against host malignant cells, cardamonin is emerging as a promising novel experimental anticancer agent. The potential of cardamonin to target various signaling molecules, transcriptional factors, cytokines and enzymes, such as mTOR, NF-\u03baB, Akt, STAT3, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and COX-2 enhances the opportunity to explore it as a new multi-target therapeutic agent. The pharmacokinetic and biosafety profile of cardamonin favor it as a potentially safe biomolecule for pharmaceutical drug development."

Dendrobium species are known to produce a variety of secondary metabolites such as phenanthrens, bibenzyls, fluorenones and sesquiterpenes, and alkaloids and are responsible for their wide variety of medicinal properties. For decades, bibenzyls, which are the main bioactive components derived from Dendrobium species, have been subjected to extensive investigation as likely candidates for cancer treatment. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of moscatilin, a bibenzyl derivative from the orchid Dendrobium loddigesii on human melanoma cells. In A375\u00a0cells compound moscatilin showed a clear dose-response relationship in the range of 6.25-50\u00a0\u03bcM concentrations. In addition, we demonstrated an apoptotic response after treatment of cancer cells with this bibenzyl compound at 6.25 and 12.5\u00a0\u03bcM concentrations that probably involves PTEN activity, inhibition of Hsp70 expression and reactive oxygen species production. Alternatively, the inhibition of the caspase cascade at higher concentrations, 25 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM, correlated with additional reactive oxygen species increase, probably switched the mode of moscatilin-induced cell death from apoptosis to necrosis."

Cancer outcomes were monitored for at least 10 years from recruitment with English, Finnish, and Welsh participants being monitored for up to 20 years.

Participants were followed for a mean of 10 years approximating 8500 person-years. 40 (9%) of 427 participants who received aspirin developed colorectal cancer compared with 58 (13%) of 434 who received placebo. Intention-to-treat Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed a significantly reduced hazard ratio (HR) of 0\u00b765 (95% CI 0\u00b743-0\u00b797; p=0\u00b7035) for aspirin versus placebo. Negative binomial regression to account for multiple primary events gave an incidence rate ratio of 0\u00b758 (0\u00b739-0\u00b787; p=0\u00b70085). Per-protocol analyses restricted to 509 who achieved 2 years' intervention gave an HR of 0\u00b756 (0\u00b734-0\u00b791; p=0\u00b7019) and an incidence rate ratio of 0\u00b750 (0\u00b731-0\u00b782; p=0\u00b70057). Non-colorectal Lynch syndrome cancers were reported in 36 participants who received aspirin and 36 participants who received placebo. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses showed no effect. For all Lynch syndrome cancers combined, the intention-to-treat analysis did not reach significance but per-protocol analysis showed significantly reduced overall risk for the aspirin group (HR=0\u00b763, 0\u00b743-0\u00b792; p=0\u00b7018).

The dose-escalation cohort comprised patients aged 18 years or older enrolled from three academic hospitals in Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours with variable HER2 status who were refractory to standard cancer treatment. A separate cohort of patients were enrolled to the dose-expansion phase from 15 hospitals in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK. Dose-expansion cohorts included patients aged 18 years or older with breast, gastric, urothelial, or endometrial cancer with at least HER2 immunohistochemistry 1+ expression and measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Trastuzumab duocarmazine was administered intravenously on day 1 of each 3-week cycle. In the dose-escalation phase, trastuzumab duocarmazine was given at doses of 0\u00b73 mg/kg to 2\u00b74 mg/kg (3\u2008+\u20083 design) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint of the dose-escalation phase was to assess safety and ascertain the recommended phase 2 dose, which would be the dose used in the dose-expansion phase. The primary endpoint of the dose-expansion phase was the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (complete response or partial response), as assessed by the investigator using RECIST version 1.1.

One dose-limiting toxic effect (death from pneumonitis) occurred at the highest administered dose (2\u00b74 mg/kg) in the dose-escalation phase. One further death occurred in the dose-escalation phase (1\u00b75 mg/kg cohort) due to disease progression, which was attributed to general physical health decline. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events reported more than once in the dose-escalation phase were keratitis (n=3) and fatigue (n=2). Based on all available data, the recommended phase 2 dose was set at 1\u00b72 mg/kg. In the dose-expansion phase, treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 16 (11%) of 146 patients, most commonly infusion-related reactions (two [1%]) and dyspnoea (two [1%]). The most common treatment-related adverse events (grades 1-4) were fatigue (48 [33%] of 146 patients), conjunctivitis (45 [31%]), and dry eye (45 [31%]). Most patients (104 [71%] of 146) had at least one ocular adverse event, with grade 3 events reported in ten (7%) of 146 patients. No patients died from treatment-related adverse events and four patients died due to disease progression, which were attributed to hepatic failure (n=1), upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage (n=1), neurological decompensation (n=1), and renal failure (n=1). In the breast cancer dose-expansion cohorts, 16 (33%, 95% CI 20\u00b74-48\u00b74) of 48 assessable patients with HER2-positive breast cancer achieved an objective response (all partial responses) according to RECIST. Nine (28%, 95% CI 13\u00b78-46\u00b78) of 32 patients with HER2-low, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and six (40%, 16\u00b73-67\u00b76) of 15 patients with HER2-low, hormone receptor-negative breast cancer achieved an objective response (all partial responses).

        "paragraph_text": "Gastric cancer (GC) is the first cancer-related cause of death in Chile; however, no plan for GC early detection has been implemented in this country. The OLGA system characterizes gastritis from stages 0 to IV according to the risk of developing GC based on H. pylori infection, atrophy, metaplasia and GC. In this study, the performance of the OLGA system was evaluated in 485 Chilean patients receiving routine endoscopy to improve the detection of early GC or preneoplastic lesions. The results showed that OLGA scores, atrophy, metaplasia and GC increased significantly with age (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Conversely, H. pylori infection was higher in younger groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). All gastric lesions were more frequent in men than women. The majority of patients with atrophy also had metaplasia (99%, p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Patients with H. pylori infection had more gastric atrophy and metaplasia than those without infection (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Of the 485 patients, 21 (4.3%) had GC, being 2.3 times more frequent among men than women and about 2/3 (14) were in OLGA stage \u22652. In addition, 19 (90%) GC patients had atrophy and 18 (85%) had metaplasia (p\u2009<\u20090.001). In conclusion, the OLGA system facilitated the evaluation of GC precursor lesions particularly in patients with an OLGA score\u2009>\u20092 between 45 and 56\u00a0years old, because this group showed atrophy and intestinal metaplasia more frequently. Therefore, biennial endoscopic surveillance of patients with an OLGA >2 can be an important health policy in Chile for diagnosing GC in its early stages and reducing mortality over the next two decades."

Median time to global health status/QoL deterioration was not reached in olaparib patients and was 15.3 months for TPC patients (hazard ratio: 0.44 [95% CI: 0.25, 0.77]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). For EORTC QLQ-C30 symptoms and functioning subscales, only nausea/vomiting symptom score was worse in the olaparib arm than in the TPC arm (across all visits compared with baseline).",

The utility of pre-screening ovarian cancer specimens for MSI to identify potential patients for germline screening for MMR mutations is uncertain. 656 women with malignant ovarian cancer underwent both MSI testing and germline mutation testing for large rearrangements in three MMR genes, MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6. Germline DNA sequencing data for the same genes was available. Among the 656 women, only four (0.6%) carried a clearly pathogenic MMR mutation. All four cancers from patients with mutations had loss of two or more microsatellite markers (MSI-high). Eighty-four of 652 (13.0%) women without a mutation had MSI-high ovarian cancers. Using MSI-high as a prescreening criterion, the sensitivity of MSI testing to identify germline MMR gene mutations was 100% and the positive predictive value was 4.5%. Germline mutations in MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 are rare among unselected cases of ovarian cancer. Patients with germline mutations often will have MSI-positive cancers and pre-screening of ovarian cancer specimens may be an efficient way of identifying patients with Lynch syndrome."

The results of the accelerated failure time model illustrate that giving more weight to later events (as in the log rank test) can affect conclusions, (iv) the assumption that accruing additional events will always ensure gain in power needs to be challenged.

Herein, we evaluated OS in patients with M1 NPC undergoing chemotherapy alone versus CRT. Methods: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for M1 NPC cases. Patients undergoing no/unknown chemotherapy and/or with unknown/nondefinitive radiotherapy (RT) doses (<60 Gy) were excluded. Logistic regression analysis ascertained clinical factors associated with RT administration. Kaplan-Meier analysis evaluated OS between both cohorts; Cox proportional hazards modeling assessed factors associated with OS. Survival was then evaluated between matched populations using inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment. OS between groups was also measured in patients surviving \u22651 and \u22653 years to address bias from poor-prognostic subsets (eg, widely disseminated disease), and those receiving CRT \u226430 and \u226460 days of each other (surrogates for concurrent CRT) versus >30 and >60 days (sequential) of each other. Results: Of 555 patients, 296 (53%) received chemotherapy alone and 259 (47%) underwent CRT. Patients undergoing CRT more often had private insurance (P=.001) and lived in areas with higher education levels (P=.028). Median OS in the chemotherapy-only and CRT cohorts were 13.7 and 25.8 months, respectively (P<.001); differences persisted between matched populations (P<.001). On multivariate analysis, receipt of additional RT independently predicted for improved OS (P<.001). OS differences between cohorts remained apparent when evaluating patients surviving for \u22651 (P<.001) and \u22653 (P=.002) years. Patients who received concurrent or sequential CRT displayed improved OS over those receiving chemotherapy alone, for both the 30-day (P<.001) and 60-day cutoffs (P<.001). Conclusions: Patients with M1 NPC undergoing definitive RT and chemotherapy experienced higher survival than those receiving chemotherapy alone. Risk stratification and patient selection for such combined modality interventions is critical."

The purpose of this exploratory analysis was to investigate neutropenic complications in the phase III PANTHER trial of standard 3-weekly chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and cyclophosphamide plus docetaxel (FEC/D) versus bi-weekly tailored dose-dense EC/D adjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.Patients and methods: Febrile neutropenia, neutropenic infection and infection grade 3-4 according to CTC AE 3.0, were explored in relation to G-CSF use. Per cycle analysis was performed concerning dose reduction and dose delays in conjunction with G-CSF administration.Results: In the experimental group, 98.9% of patients received primary G-CSF support during EC and 97.4% during docetaxel, compared with 49.7% during FEC and 63.88% during docetaxel in the standard group. Overall, the use of G-CSF was associated with a lower risk for developing neutropenic events (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.35-0.55, p\u2009<\u2009.001). Chemotherapy delays due to neutropenia and leukopenia were significantly decreased among patients that received G-CSF (OR 0.098, 95% CI 0.06-0.15 and OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18-0.58, respectively).Discussion: In conclusion, G-CSF support reduces neutropenic events and permits increased relative dose intensity, which is essential for improved survival outcomes."

Thus, the major aim of this study was to assess the effect of dietary intervention along with nutritional education on reducing these side effects. The present study is a single-center, single-controlled, and randomized trial. A total of 150 patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy were randomly assigned into intervention group to receive dietary intervention and nutritional education (n\u2009=\u200973) or control group (n\u2009=\u200967) for 10\u2009weeks, after their three sessions of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was the GI symptoms after each session of chemotherapy that were measured by a designed questionnaire based on ROMIII questionnaire. The severity of GI side effects in the dietary intervention along with nutritional education was decreased significantly in the third session of chemotherapy compared to the first session, which include reflux disorder (P\u2009=\u20090.05), anorexia (P\u2009<\u20090.001), nausea (P\u2009=\u20090.002), constipation (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and diarrhea (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Moreover, significant reductions were observed in the severity of GI side effects in the intervention group compared to control group after the third session (P\u2009<\u20090.001). After adjusting the analysis for baseline values including age, job, education level, weight, and body mass index, significant changes were observed for GI side effects in the intervention group compared to the control group (P\u2009<\u20090.001). This study showed beneficial effects of individualized dietary intervention along with nutritional education on reducing diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, and nausea in women with breast cancer during the chemotherapy."

Since Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are considered a crucial step of metastatic process, we explored RANK expression on CTCs in metastatic breast cancer (MBC), and the predictive value of RANK-positive CTCs in monitoring patients during treatment with denosumab (anti-RANKL antibody). To this purpose, we developed a novel CTC assay to quantify RANK-positive CTCs in forty-two bone MBC patients, candidates to denosumab treatment. Companion algorithms \u0394AUC and Slope were developed, and correlated with time to first skeletal-related-events (SRE), time to bone metastasis progression and time to visceral metastasis progression. Twenty-seven patients had at least one CTC at baseline and, among these, nineteen (70%) had one or more RANK-positive CTCs. Notably, the baseline total CTCs, but not the RANK-positive, were associated with Time-to-first-SRE, Time-to-Bone-Metastasis-Progression and Time-to-Visceral-Metastasis-Progression. Conversely, during treatment monitoring, positive \u0394AUC value, expression of RANK-positive CTCs persistence, correlated with longer Time-to-first-SRE (p\u2009=\u20090.0002) and Time-to-Bone-Metastasis-Progression (p\u2009=\u20090.0012). Furthermore, the early increase at second day, in RANK-positive CTCs (Positive-Slope) was associated with delay in time-to-first-SRE (p\u2009=\u20090.0038) and Time-to-Bone-Metastasis-Progression (p\u2009=\u20090.0024). We demonstrate, for the first time, the expression of RANK on CTCs in MBC patients and that the persistence of RANK expression determines denosumab effectiveness."

Ki67 has been identified as a prognostic and predictive marker in ER-positive breast cancer. Ninety ER-positive, HER2 negative locally advanced breast cancer patients received letrozole (2.5 mg daily) and cyclophosphamide (50 mg daily) with/without Sorafenib (400 mg/bid daily) for 6 months before undergoing surgery. Ki67 expression and tumor size measured with caliber were determined at baseline, after 30 days of treatment and at the end of treatment. Patients were assigned to a clinical response category according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, both at 30 days and before surgery and further classified as high-responder and low-responder according to the median variation of Ki67 values between biopsy and 30 days and between biopsy and surgery time. The predictive role of Ki67 and its changes with regard to clinical response and survival was analyzed. No differences in terms of survival outcomes emerged between the arms of treatment, while we observed a higher percentage of women with progression or stable disease in arm with the combination containing Sorafenib (20.5% vs 7.1%, p = 0.06). Clinical complete responders experienced a greater overall variation in Ki67 when compared with partial responders and patients with progressive/stable disease (66.7% vs 30.7%, p = 0.009). High responders showed a better outcome than low responders in terms of both disease-free survival (p = 0.009) and overall survival (p = 0.002). \u0394Ki67 score evaluated between basal and residual tumor at definitive surgery showed to be highly predictive of clinical complete response, and a potential parameter to be used for predicting disease-free survival and overall survival in luminal breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant endocrine-based therapy."

Although many mechanisms regulating the development of bulliform cells have been reported, the fine regulatory mechanisms governing this process have rarely been described. To identify novel components regulating rice leaf morphology, a mutant showing a constitutively rolling phenotype from the seedling stage to flowering, known as crm1-D, was selected for further analysis. Anatomical analyses in crm1-D were attributable to the size reduction of bulliform cells. The crm1-D was controlled by a single dominant nuclear gene. Map-based cloning revealed that Roc8, an HD zipper class IV family member, was responsible for the crm1-D phenotype. Notably, the 50-bp sequence in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the Roc8 gene represses Roc8 at the translational level. Moreover, the roc8 knockdown lines notably increased the size of bulliform cells. A series of assays revealed that Roc8 negatively regulates the size of bulliform cells. Unexpectedly, Roc8 was also observed to positively mediate lignin biosynthesis without incurring a production penalty. The above results show that Roc8 may have a practical application in cultivating materials with high photosynthetic efficiency and low lignin content."

        "paragraph_text": "Terminal drought substantially reduces chickpea yield. Reducing water use at vegetative stage by reducing transpiration under high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), i.e. under dry/hot conditions, contributes to drought adaptation. We hypothesized that this trait could relate to differences in a genotype's dependence on root water transport pathways and hydraulics. Transpiration rate responses in conservative and profligate chickpea genotypes were evaluated under increasing VPD in the presence/absence of apoplastic and cell-to-cell transport inhibitors. Conservative genotypes ICC 4958 and ICC 8058 restricted transpiration under high VPD compared to the profligate genotypes ICC 14799 and ICC 867. Profligate genotypes were more affected by aquaporin inhibition of the cell-to-cell pathway than conservative genotypes, as measured by the root hydraulic conductance and transpiration under high VPD. Aquaporin inhibitor treatment also led to a larger reduction in root hydraulic conductivity in profligate than in conservative genotypes. In contrast, blockage of the apoplastic pathway in roots decreased transpiration more in conservative than in profligate genotypes. Interestingly, conservative genotypes had high early vigour, whereas profligate genotypes had low early vigour. In conclusion, profligate genotypes depend more on the cell-to-cell pathway, which might explain their higher root hydraulic conductivity, whereas water-saving by restricting transpiration led to higher dependence on the apoplastic pathway. This opens the possibility to screen for conservative or profligate chickpea phenotypes using inhibitors, itself opening to the search of the genetic basis of these differences."

Transforming growth factor beta-inducible protein (TGFBI) is an extracellular matrix component involved in tumour growth and metastasis. However, the exact role of TGFBI in NSCLC remains controversial. Gene silencing via DNA methylation of the promoter region is common in lung tumorigenesis and could thus be used for the development of molecular biomarkers. We analysed the methylation status of the TGFBI promoter in 138 NSCLC specimens via methylation-specific PCR and evaluated the correlation between TGFBI methylation and patient survival. TGFBI promoter methylation was detected in 25 (18.1%) of the tumours and was demonstrated to be associated with gene silencing. We observed no statistical correlation between TGFBI methylation and clinicopathological characteristics. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that TGFBI methylation is significantly associated with poor survival outcomes in adenocarcinoma cases (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.88, 95% confidence interval = 1.19-6.99, P = 0.019), but not in squamous cell cases. Our findings suggest that methylation in the TGFBI promoter may be associated with pathogenesis of NSCLC and can be used as a predictive marker for lung adenocarcinoma prognosis. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings."

The antineoplastic properties of synthetic liver X receptor (LXR) agonists (T0901317 and GW3965) have been reported in human carcinomas. Epidermal growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) is a first-line treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations. We used scratch and transwell assays to analyze cell migration and invasion. We evaluated tumor migration and invasion in vitro using a fluorescent orthotopic lung cancer model. An MMP9 (mouse) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit was used to measure serum MMP9 concentrations. Protein expression was identified by western blot assays. In this study, we determined the effects of T0901317 and/or an EGFR-TKI on the lung cancer cell lines A549 and HCC827-8-1 in vitro and in vivo. We confirmed that the combination of the LXR agonist T0901317 and gefitinib can inhibit the migration and invasion of lung cancer both in vivo and in vitro, and this effect was possibly achieved by the inhibition of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. Our study showed that the combination of the LXR agonist T0901317 and gefitinib can inhibit the migration and invasion of lung cancer both in vivo and in vitro."

        "paragraph_text": "Prospective cohort studies have indicated that a highly nickel-polluted environment may severely affect human health, resulting in such conditions as respiratory tract cancers. Such exposure can trigger vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. However, the signal transduction pathways leading to VEGF induction by nickel compounds are not well understood. This study revealed the occurrence of VEGF induction in human non-small-cell lung cancer H460 cells exposed to NiCl2 . Moreover, exposing H460 cells to NiCl2 activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03baB), and protein kinase B (Akt) as well as downregulated AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ERK inhibitor significantly blocked NiCl2 -induced ERK activation and VEGF production. Pretreating H460 cells with a PI3K/Akt inhibitor substantially inhibited NiCl2 -induced VEGF expression and reduced Akt, ERK, and NF\u03baB phosphorylation. Furthermore, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside-induced AMPK activation improved VEGF expression in NiCl2 -treated H460 cells significantly. These results indicate that NiCl2 induces VEGF production through Akt, ERK, NF\u03baB activation and AMPK suppression and mediates various types of pathophysiological angiogenesis."

PTEN\u00a0tumour suppressor gene inactivation is a frequent event in T-ALL but its effect on patient therapy response is debatable. We analysed the effect of the presence of mutated PTEN\u00a0on outcome in 257 children with T-ALL treated with Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP)-Berlin-Frankf\u00fcrt-M\u00fcnster (BFM) protocols. PTEN\u00a0mutations were present in 31 (12\u00b71%) patients and were significantly associated with increased risk of relapse. PTEN mutations also indicate a poor prognosis in T-ALL patients in the absence of\u00a0NOTCH1\u00a0mutations or in the group of patients with co-presence of PTEN mutation and deletions. These results indicate that PTEN genomic aberrations and the biologically consequential PTEN inactivation contribute to adverse therapy response in T-ALL patients; PTEN status as a biomarker may contribute to the development of new molecularly-defined stratification algorithms."

In first-line aromatase inhibitor-treated patients (n=2252), the median progression-free survival in the CDKI plus aromatase inhibitor group was 28\u00b70 months (95% CI 25\u00b73-29\u00b71) versus 14\u00b79 months (14\u00b70-16\u00b77) in the placebo plus aromatase inhibitor group (difference 13\u00b71 months; range across the trials 13\u00b70-13\u00b73 months; HR 0\u00b755, 95% CI 0\u00b749-0\u00b762). In first-line fulvestrant-treated patients (n=396), the median progression-free survival was 18\u00b76 months (95% CI 14\u00b78-23\u00b75) in the placebo plus fulvestrant group and not estimable (22\u00b74 to not estimable) in the CDKI plus fulvestrant group (difference not estimable; HR 0\u00b758, 95% CI 0\u00b742-0\u00b780). In the patients treated with fulvestrant in the second-line setting and beyond (n=1552), the difference in estimated median progression-free survival between the CDKI plus fulvestrant group and the placebo plus fulvestrant group was 6\u00b79 months in favour of the CDKI group (range across the trials 5\u00b75-7\u00b73 months; HR 0\u00b756, 95% CI 0\u00b749-0\u00b764).",

Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7%\u00a0and 1.2% (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4%\u00a0and 2.7% in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5%. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88%. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening."

Four (67%) had negative-margin resections. Four patients had histologic evidence of a moderate response.

The number of eligible patients referred to clinical genetic services (CGS), and the number of LS patients per center was determined. 3906 patients were included over a 9-year period. dMMR CRCs were found in 32/153 (21%) of patients at CC1 and 55/536 (10%) at CC2, accounting for 3% and 5% of the CRC population, respectively. At CC3, 182/1737 patients (10%) had dMMR CRCs (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Additional testing for the BRAF V600E mutation, was performed in 49 patients at CC3 prior to CGS referral, of which 29 were positive and considered sporadic CRC. Referrals to CGS were made in 66%, 33%, and 30% of eligible patients at CC1, CC2, and CC3, respectively. LS accounted for CRC in eight patients (0.8%) at CC1, eight patients (0.7%) at CC2, and 20 patients (1.2%) at CC3. Cascade testing of patients with dMMR CRC was not completed in 56%. Universal screening increases the detection of dMMR tumors and LS kindreds. Successful implementation of this approach requires adequate resources for appropriate downstream management of these patients."

During a median of 11.2 years of follow-up (3.8 million person-years at risk), 2168 women developed ovarian cancer (58 cases/100\u202f000 person-years). Ovarian cancer incidence was 61 cases/100\u202f000 person-years among ever users and 55 cases/100\u202f000 person-years among never users (estimated risk difference at age 70 years, 0.09% [95% CI, -0.02% to 0.19%]; estimated HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.17]).

However, cancer communicators have yet to systematically leverage these naturally occurring interventions on social media as these events are difficult to identify as they are unfolding and little research has analyzed their effect on social media conversations. In this study, we add to the research by analyzing how a celebrity cancer announcement influenced Twitter conversations in terms of the volume of social media messages and the type of content. Over a 9-day period, during which actor Ben Stiller announced that he had been treated for prostate cancer, we collected 1.2 million Twitter messages about cancer. We conducted automated content analyses to identify how often common cancer sites (prostate, breast, colon, or lung) were discussed. Then, we used manual content analysis on a sample of messages to identify cancer continuum content (awareness, prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and end of life). Chi-square analyses were implemented to evaluate changes in cancer site and cancer continuum content before and after the announcement. We found that messages related to prostate cancer increased significantly more than expected for 2 days following Stiller's announcement. However, the number of cancer messages that described other cancer locations either did not increase or did not increase by the same magnitude. In terms of message content, results showed larger than expected increases in diagnosis messages. These results suggest opportunities to shape social media conversations following celebrity cancer announcements and increase prevention and early detection messages."

Despite the variable definition of PD-L1 positivity in tumors, an association between expression and response has been reasonably consistent in advanced NSCLC. In addition, the clinical efficacy of ICIs seems to be related to the genomic landscape of the tumor in terms of mutational burden and clonal neoantigens. Furthermore, increasing evidence shows that excessive activation of the immune response elicited by ICIs, leading to immune-related toxicities, might be associated with an improved response to immunotherapy. There are still many unanswered questions about the proper use of these agents to maximize their efficacy, which may be improved through combination with radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, or other immune mediators, including dual checkpoint blockade. To search for clues for addressing these challenges, this review focused on the characteristics and clinical features of long-term NSCLC survivors and the potential biomarkers of response to ICIs."

Despite high variability in the testing protocols, dynamic tests remained the most accurate for appropriately identifying patients with GHD. The insulin tolerance test (ITT) appears to be the most accepted reference test when used alone or in combination with arginine; however, standardized testing strategies among practice groups are absent. GHRH and arginine stimulation performed almost similarly to the ITT; however, in one study GHRH with arginine stimulation had 66% sensitivity and 88% specificity compared with the ITT. Insufficient data were available to assess the accuracy of serial GH testing (nocturnal or over 24 hours).",

Self-administered health history questionnaires (HHQs) may provide a low-cost method to detail family history (FH) of malignancy. Pancreas Center patients were asked to enroll in a registry; 149 with PDAC completed a HHQ which included FH data. Patients with FH of PDAC, or concern for inherited PDAC syndrome, were separately evaluated in a Prevention Program and additionally met with a genetic counselor (GC) to assess PDAC risk (n\u2009=\u200961). FH obtained through GC and HHQ were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank sum and generalized linear mixed models with Poisson distribution. Agreement between GC and HHQ risk-assessment was assessed using kappa (\u03ba) statistic. In the Prevention Program, HHQ was as precise in detecting FH of cancer as the GC (all p\u2009>\u20090.05). GC and HHQ demonstrated substantial agreement in risk-stratification of the Prevention Program cohort (\u03ba\u2009=\u20090.73, 95% CI 0.59-0.87.) The sensitivity of the HHQ to detect a patient at elevated risk (i.e., moderate- or high-risk) of PDAC, compared to GC, was 82.9% (95% CI 67.3-92.3%) with a specificity of 95% (95% CI 73.1-99.7%). However, seven patients who were classified as average-risk by the HHQ were found to be at an elevated-risk of PDAC by the GC. In the PDAC cohort, 30/149 (20.1%) reported at least one first-degree relative (FDR) with PDAC. The limited sensitivity of the HHQ to detect patients at elevated risk of PDAC in the Prevention Program cohort suggests that a GC adds value in risk-assessment in this population. The HHQ may offer an opportunity to identify high-risk patients in a PDAC population."

We compared risk in full-Jewish subjects with risk in part-Jewish; non-Jewish Southern European; and in the combined non-Jewish Eastern, Northern, Southern, and Western European (non-Jewish white European) subjects from the same datasets. Jewish ancestries were genetically identified using seeded Fast principal component analysis. Data were analyzed by unconditional logistic regression, and adjusted for age, sex, and principal components.Results: One SNP on chromosome 13q22.1 (rs9543325; OR, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.58; P = 10-4.1) was significant in full-Jews. Individual ORs and minor allele frequencies were similar between Jewish and non-Jewish white European subjects. The average ORs across the 16 pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci for full-Jewish, full- plus part-Jewish, non-Jewish Southern European, and non-Jewish white European subjects were 1.25, 1.30, 1.31, and 1.26, respectively.Conclusions: The 16 pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci similarly impact Jewish and non-Jewish white European subjects, both individually and as summary odds.Impact: These 16 pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci likely do not explain the higher risk seen in Ashkenazi Jews.

Median follow-up at data cutoff (April 30, 2018) was 44 months (IQR 38-49) in the dabrafenib plus trametinib group and 42 months (21-49) in the placebo group. Intrinsic tumour genomic features were assessed in 368 patients (DNA sequencing set) and tumour microenvironment characteristics were assessed in 507 patients (NanoString biomarker set). MAPK pathway genomic alterations at baseline did not affect treatment benefit or clinical outcome. An IFN\u03b3 gene expression signature higher than the median was prognostic for prolonged relapse-free survival in both treatment groups. Tumour mutational burden was independently prognostic for relapse-free survival in the placebo group (high TMB, top third; hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b756, 95% CI 0\u00b737-0\u00b785, p=0\u00b70056), but not in the dabrafenib plus trametinib group (0\u00b783, 95% CI 0\u00b753-1\u00b732, p=0\u00b744). Patients with tumour mutational burden in the lower two terciles seem to derive a substantial long-term relapse-free survival benefit from targeted therapy (HR [versus placebo] 0\u00b749, 95% CI 0\u00b735-0\u00b768, p<0\u00b70001). However, patients with high tumour mutational burden seem to have a less pronounced benefit with targeted therapy (HR [versus placebo] 0\u00b775, 95% CI 0\u00b744-1\u00b726, p=0\u00b727), especially if they had an IFN\u03b3 signature lower than the median (HR 0\u00b788 [95% CI 0\u00b740-1\u00b793], p=0\u00b774).",

The first historical mention of what is now called the familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome appears to be from 1820, with more reports throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and later years. In 1991, Lynch and Fusaro described an association between familial multiple mole melanoma and pancreatic cancer and work continues to elucidate the syndrome's genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Individuals at risk for familial melanoma need periodic screenings. Unfortunately, adequate screening for pancreatic cancer does not currently exist, but pancreatic cancer's prominence in the hereditary setting will hopefully act as a stimulus for development of novel screening measures."

        "paragraph_text": "Doxorubicin is among the most effective and widely used anticancer drugs in the clinic. However, cardiotoxicity is one of the life-threatening side effects of doxorubicin-based therapy. Dexrazoxane (Zinecard, also known as ICRF-187) has been used in the clinic as a cardioprotectant against doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. The molecular basis for doxorubicin cardiotoxicity and the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane, however, is not fully understood. In the present study, we showed that dexrazoxane specifically abolished the DNA damage signal gamma-H2AX induced by doxorubicin, but not camptothecin or hydrogen peroxide, in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. Doxorubicin-induced DNA damage was also specifically abolished by the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and MG132 and much reduced in top2beta(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) compared with TOP2beta(+/+) MEFs, suggesting the involvement of proteasome and DNA topoisomerase IIbeta (Top2beta). Furthermore, in addition to antagonizing Top2 cleavage complex formation, dexrazoxane also induced rapid degradation of Top2beta, which paralleled the reduction of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage. Together, our results suggest that dexrazoxane antagonizes doxorubicin-induced DNA damage through its interference with Top2beta, which could implicate Top2beta in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. The specific involvement of proteasome and Top2beta in doxorubicin-induced DNA damage is consistent with a model in which proteasomal processing of doxorubicin-induced Top2beta-DNA covalent complexes exposes the Top2beta-concealed DNA double-strand breaks."

Approval was based on data from Study CLTR0310-301, a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial comparing Vyxeos with a standard combination of daunorubicin and cytarabine (\"7+3\") in 309 patients 60-75 years of age with newly diagnosed t-AML or AML-MRC. Because of elemental copper concerns with the Vyxeos formulation, patients with Wilson disease were excluded from the study. Vyxeos demonstrated an improvement in overall survival (HR 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.90; P = 0.005) with an estimated median overall survival of 9.6 months compared with 5.9 months for the \"7+3\" control arm. The toxicity profile of Vyxeos was similar to that seen with standard \"7+3\" with the exception of more prolonged neutropenia and thrombocytopenia on the Vyxeos arm. Because the pharmacology of Vyxeos differs from that of other formulations of daunorubicin and cytarabine, labeling includes a warning against interchanging formulations during treatment. This is the first FDA-approved treatment specifically for patients with t-AML or AML-MRC."

Peripartum cardiomyopathy is diagnosed in women without a history of heart disease 1 month before delivery or within 5 months postpartum. About half of all women will have full myocardial recovery within 6 months of diagnosis, but complications such as severe heart failure or death are not rare. African-American women have higher rates of diagnosis and adverse events. Women with preexisting cardiomyopathy, such as dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, followed closely during pregnancy often tolerate pregnancy and delivery. Risk factors for adverse outcomes include functional status at baseline, severity of systolic dysfunction or outflow tract gradient, or history of prior cardiac event, such as arrhythmia or stroke. The level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to risk stratify women for adverse events. Pregnant women with cardiomyopathy should be followed closely by a multidisciplinary team comprised of nurses, obstetricians, neonatologists, cardiologists, anesthesiologists, and cardiac surgeons."

Incidence and risk factors for peripartum cardiac dysfunction and maternal cardiac outcomes in this population were investigated. Eligible long-term survivors were aged <30 years at cancer diagnosis, with \u22651 pregnancy occurring \u22655 years after diagnosis. \"Peripartum\" cardiac events were defined as occurring within pregnancy or \u22645months after delivery. Cardiac events were classified \"symptomatic\" or \"subclinical\". \"Peripartum cardiomyopathy\" (PPCM) was defined as symptomatic dysfunction without prior cardiac dysfunction. Of 64 eligible women, 5 (7.8%) had peripartum cardiac events: 3 symptomatic, 2 subclinical. Of 110 live births, 2 (1.8%, 95% CI 0.2-6.4) were defined as PPCM: Significantly greater than the published general population incidence of 1:3000 (p < 0.001), representing a 55-fold (95% CI 6.6-192.0) increased risk. Risk factor analyses were hypothesis-generating, revealing younger age at cancer diagnosis and higher anthracycline dose. Postpartum, cardiac function of 4 women (80%) failed to return to baseline. In conclusion, peripartum cardiac dysfunction is an uncommon but potentially serious complication in long-term survivors of paediatric and AYA malignancies previously treated with cardiotoxic therapies. Peripartum cardiac assessment is strongly recommended for at-risk patients."

Utilizing data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of 14,364 five-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed at 26 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada between 1970 and 1986 and followed through 2009, the occurrence of hypothyroidism was ascertained among 12,015 survivors through serial questionnaires. Radiation doses to the thyroid gland and pituitary gland were estimated from radiotherapy records. Binary outcome regression was used to estimate prevalence odds ratios for hypothyroidism at five years from diagnosis of childhood cancer and Poisson regression to model incidence rate ratios (RR) after the first five years. A total of 1,193 cases of hypothyroidism were observed, 777 (65%) of which occurred five or more years after cancer diagnosis. The cumulative proportion affected with hypothyroidism (prevalence at five years after cancer diagnosis plus incidence through 30 years after cancer diagnosis) was highest among five-year survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma (32.3%; 95% CI: 29.5-34.9) and cancers of the central nervous system (17.7%; 95% CI: 15.2-20.4). The incidence rate was significantly associated with radiation dose to the thyroid and pituitary. The joint association of hypothyroidism with thyroid and pituitary dose was sub-additive for pituitary doses greater than 16 Gy. In particular, a very strong thyroid radiation dose dependence at low-to-moderate pituitary/hypothalamic doses was diminished at high pituitary doses. Radiation-related risks were higher in males than females and inversely associated with age at exposure and time since exposure but remained elevated more than 25 years after exposure. Our findings indicated that hypothyroidism was significantly associated with treatment with bleomycin (RR = 3.4; 95% CI: 1.6-7.3) and the alkylating agents cyclohexyl-chloroethyl-nitrosourea (CCNU) (RR = 3.0; 95% CI: 1.5-5.3) and cyclophosphamide (RR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.0-1.8), with a significant dose response for CCNU ( P < 0.01). The risk of hypothyroidism among childhood cancer survivors treated with radiation depends both on direct, dose-dependent radiation-induced damage to the thyroid gland and on dose-dependent indirect effects secondary to irradiation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The dose-response relationship for each site depends on dose to the other. Radiation-related risk persists for more than 25 years after treatment. Treatment with certain chemotherapy agents may increase the risk of hypothyroidism."

The clinical course is heterogeneous ranging from spontaneous regression in neonates to life-threatening metastatic disease in older children. Much of this clinical variance is thought to result from distinct pathologic characteristics that predict patient outcomes. Consequently, many research efforts have been focused on identifying the underlying biologic and genetic features of neuroblastoma tumors in order to more clearly define prognostic subgroups for treatment stratification. Recent technological advances have placed emphasis on the integration of genetic alterations and predictive biologic variables into targeted treatment approaches to improve patient survival outcomes. This review will focus on these recent advances and the implications they have on the diagnostic, staging, and treatment approaches in modern neuroblastoma clinical management."

        "paragraph_text": "Molecular breast imaging (MBI), also called breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI), has been an integral component of our breast imaging practice for over a decade. Unlike mammography and ultrasound that are based on anatomy, MBI is a physiologic approach to breast cancer detection. MBI detects additional foci of occult breast cancer in 9.0% of women with newly diagnosed breast cancer, has a high sensitivity for detecting high-risk lesions, and detects 98% of invasive breast cancer and 91.0% of ductal carcinoma in situ. Furthermore, in surveillance of high-risk women, BSGI/MBI detects occult cancer in up to 16.5 per 1000 women. This modality is increasingly being used to assess response to treatment in women undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and for adjunct screening in women with dense breasts. It has been shown to influence surgical management in nearly a quarter of women with newly diagnosed breast cancer. The Society of Nuclear Imaging has established clinical indications and The American College of Radiology has established appropriateness criteria as well as an accreditation program for MBI. A BIRADS-like lexicon for MBI has also been described. Initially, MBI utilized 10-20mCi of 99mTc sestamibi, however, recent studies have reported the use of 5-10mCi with equal sensitivity to the higher dose of radiotracer. There are over 300 studies in the literature about MBI/BSGI with increasing integration of MBI into clinical practice. This chapter will describe the history, current literature and indications, clinical use, approach to biopsy and integration of MBI into clinical practice."

Included in this study were 567 RET carriers. The age-related progression of MTC across histopathological groups (normal thyroid/C-cell hyperplasia; node-negative MTC; node-positive MTC) was statistically significant for 13 unique RET mutations (p.Cys611Phe/c.1832G\u00a0>\u00a0T; p.Cys611Tyr; p.Cys618Ser/c.1852T\u00a0>\u00a0A; p.Cys620Arg; p.Cys634Arg; p.Cys634Phe; p.Cys634Ser; p.Cys634Tyr; p.Glu768Asp; p.Leu790Phe/c.2370G\u00a0>\u00a0T; p.Val804Met; p.Ser891Ala; p.Met918Thr), whereas two unique RET mutations (p.Cys618Phe; p.Cys634Gly) trended toward statistical significance. When grouped by mutational risk (highest; high; moderate-high; low-moderate; polymorphism), the age-related progression of MTC was significant for all four categories of RET mutations, which differed significantly across and within the three histopathological groups. For high, for moderate-high, and for low-moderate risk RET mutations, the age-related progression of MTC by mutated codon was broadly comparable across and within the three histopathological groups, and essentially unaffected by the amino acid substitutions examined. These data argue in favor of splitting the American Thyroid Association's moderate-risk category into moderate-high and low-moderate risk categories, while emphasizing the need to contradistinguish the latter from rare nonpathogenic polymorphisms."

We sought to replicate the associations of 61 GWAS-identified SNPs at 42 loci with pancreatic cancer in Japanese and to develop a risk model for the identification of individuals at high risk for pancreatic cancer development in the general Japanese population. The model was based on data including directly determined or imputed SNP genotypes for 664 pancreatic cancer case and 664 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Stepwise logistic regression uncovered five GWAS-identified SNPs at five loci that also showed significant associations in our case-control cohort. These five SNPs were included in the risk model and also applied to calculation of the polygenic risk score (PRS). The area under the curve determined with the leave-one-out cross-validation method was 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.60-0.66) or 0.61 (0.58-0.64) for versions of the model that did or did not include cigarette smoking and family history of pancreatic cancer in addition to the five SNPs, respectively. Individuals in the lowest and highest quintiles for the PRS had odds ratios of 0.62 (0.42-0.91) and 1.98 (1.42-2.76), respectively, for pancreatic cancer development compared with those in the middle quintile. We have thus developed a risk model for pancreatic cancer that showed moderately good discriminatory ability with regard to differentiation of pancreatic cancer patients from control individuals. Our findings suggest the potential utility of a risk model that incorporates replicated GWAS-identified SNPs and established demographic or environmental factors for the identification of individuals at increased risk for pancreatic cancer development."

Here we report highly recurrent hotspot mutations of U1 spliceosomal small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) in ~50% of Sonic hedgehog medulloblastomas (Shh-MB), which were not present across other medulloblastoma subgroups. This U1-snRNA hotspot mutation (r.3a>g), was identified in <0.1% of 2,442 cancers across 36 other tumour types. Largely absent from infant Shh-MB, the mutation occurs in 97% of adults (Shh\u03b4), and 25% of adolescents (Shh\u03b1). The U1-snRNA mutation occurs in the 5' splice site binding region, and snRNA mutant tumours have significantly disrupted RNA splicing with an excess of 5' cryptic splicing events. Mutant U1-snRNA-mediated alternative splicing inactivates tumour suppressor genes (PTCH1), and activates oncogenes (GLI2, CCND2), represents a novel target for therapy, and constitutes a highly recurrent and tissue-specific mutation of a non-protein coding gene in cancer."

Individuals were randomized to intervention or control groups. The intervention group received persuasive and innovative direct mail materials coupled with a $20 incentive for using their Medicaid benefit to get screened. Direct mail materials provided a phone number to a call center staffed by patient navigators who addressed barriers and scheduled appointments via three-way calls. The control group received the intervention 15 months later. Primary outcomes were completion of mammography or colonoscopy within 12 weeks of the intervention. Billing claims served as evidence of screening.Results: Multivariate logistic regression showed significant differences for both breast cancer (P < 0.001) and colorectal cancer (P < 0.01). The odds of receiving a mammogram for the treatment group were significantly higher than the control group [OR = 1.30; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.16-1.46], and the treatment group was more likely to receive a colonoscopy than the control group (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.04-1.21).Conclusions: This population-based intervention increased breast cancer and colorectal cancer screening in a Medicaid population overdue for screening.Impact: These findings may have broad application for reaching individuals who generally remain outside the health care system despite having public health insurance.

However, the observed incidence rates in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries may underestimate colorectal cancer case burdens in those younger than 50 years compared with those older than 50 years because average-risk screening is generally not performed to detect preclinical cases of colorectal cancer. Finding steep incidence increases of invasive stage (beyond in situ) cases of colorectal cancer from age 49 to 50 years would be consistent with high rates of preexisting, undetected cancers in younger patients ultimately receiving a diagnosis of colorectal cancer after undergoing screening at 50 years.",

Follow-up data on smoking status were provided by 82% and 77% of the participants 12 and 24 months after study inclusion, respectively.

In the intention-to-treat population, 5-year disease-free survival was 77\u00b76% (95% CI 70\u00b76-83\u00b72) with maintenance chemotherapy versus 69\u00b78% (62\u00b72-76\u00b72) without maintenance chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b768 [95% CI 0\u00b745-1\u00b702]; p=0\u00b7061), and 5-year overall survival was 86\u00b75% (95% CI 80\u00b72-90\u00b79) with maintenance chemotherapy versus 73\u00b77% (65\u00b78-80\u00b71) without (HR 0\u00b752 [95% CI 0\u00b732-0\u00b786]; p=0\u00b70097). Toxicity was manageable in patients who received maintenance chemotherapy: 136 (75%) of 181 patients had grade 3-4 leucopenia, 148 (82%) had grade 3-4 neutropenia, 19 (10%) had anaemia, two (1%) had thrombocytopenia, and 56 (31%) had an infection. One (1%) patient had a grade 4 non-haematological toxicity (neurotoxicity). Two treatment-related serious adverse events occurred: one case of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and one of a severe steppage gait with limb pain, both of which resolved.",

To assess the clinical features, outcomes, and prognostic factors of this disease, we retrospectively analyzed 185 HIV-negative CD patients from four medical centers in southern China. The median age was 37\u00a0years. One hundred and twenty-one patients (65.4%) were classified as unicentric CD (UCD) and 64 patients (34.6%) were classified as multicentric CD (MCD). The histology subtype was hyaline-vascular for 132 patients (71.4%), plasma cell for 50 patients (27%), and mixed type for 3 patients (1.6%). The 5-year overall survival (OS) of 185 CD cases was 80.3%. All UCD patients underwent surgical excision, whereas the treatment strategies of MCD patients were heterogeneous. The outcome for UCD patients was better than MCD patients, with 5-year OS rates of 93.6% and 51.2%, respectively. In further analysis of the MCD subgroup, a multivariate analysis using a Cox regression model revealed that age, splenomegaly and pretreatment serum albumin level were independent prognostic factors for OS. This multicenter study comprising the largest sample size to date suggested that MCD is a distinct entity from UCD with a significantly worse outcome. Older age (\u226540\u00a0years), splenomegaly, and hypoalbuminemia were risk factors for poorer MCD prognosis."

Previous localised disease treatment or previous docetaxel for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer were allowed. Randomisation was stratified by Gleason score at diagnosis, region, and previous docetaxel treatment. Randomisation was done using randomly permuted blocks (block size of four). Investigators, research staff, sponsor study team, and patients were masked to the identities of test and control treatments. Patient-reported outcomes were prespecified exploratory endpoints and were the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), and EuroQoL 5D questionnaire 5 level (EQ-5D-5L). BPI and BFI were completed for 7 consecutive days (days -6 to 1 inclusive of each cycle visit), then at months 4, 8, and 12 in follow-up. FACT-P and EQ-5D-5L were completed during cycles 1-7, then every other cycle until the end of treatment, and at months 4, 8, and 12 in follow-up. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat population. Missing patient-reported outcome assessments were calculated as the expected number of assessments for a visit minus the actual number of assessments received for that visit. For time-to-event endpoints, when median values could not be calculated because less than 50% of patients had degradation, 25th percentiles were compared.

At the time of primary analysis, progression-free survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group (19\u00b74 months [95% CI 15\u00b74-21\u00b76]) than in the placebo plus erlotinib group (12\u00b74 months [11\u00b70-13\u00b75]), with a stratified hazard ratio of 0\u00b759 (95% CI 0\u00b746-0\u00b776; p<0\u00b70001). Grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 159 (72%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group versus 121 (54%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group. The most common grade 3-4 treatment-emergent adverse events in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were hypertension (52 [24%]; grade 3 only) and dermatitis acneiform (33 [15%]), and in the placebo plus erlotinib group were dermatitis acneiform (20 [9%]) and increased alanine aminotransferase (17 [8%]). Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were reported in 65 (29%) of 221 patients in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group and 47 (21%) of 225 in the placebo plus erlotinib group. The most common serious adverse events of any grade in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group were pneumonia (seven [3%]) and cellulitis and pneumothorax (four [2%], each); the most common in the placebo plus erlotinib group were pyrexia (four [2%]) and pneumothorax (three [1%]). One on-study treatment-related death due to an adverse event occurred (haemothorax after a thoracic drainage procedure for a pleural empyema) in the ramucirumab plus erlotinib group.",

Method We used the Intervention Mapping framework for planning health promotion programs. After a needs assessment, we identified important changeable determinants of cessation behavior, specified objectives for the intervention, selected theoretical methods for meeting our objectives, and operationalized change methods into practical intervention strategies. Results We found that \"social cognitive theory,\" the \"transtheoretical model/stages of change,\" \"self-regulation theory,\" and \"appreciative inquiry\" were relevant theories for smoking cessation interventions. From these theories, we selected modeling/behavioral journalism, feedback, planning coping responses/if-then statements, gain frame/positive imaging, consciousness-raising, helping relationships, stimulus control, and goal-setting as suitable methods for an Internet- and text-based adult smoking cessation program. Furthermore, we identified computer tailoring as a useful strategy for adapting the intervention to individual users. Conclusion The Intervention Mapping method, with a clear link between behavioral goals, theoretical methods, and practical strategies and materials, proved useful for systematic development of a digital smoking cessation intervention for adults."

Twenty-five papers published between 1987 and 2006 were reviewed. These reveal that (1) chemotherapy always causes some height reduction during treatment regardless of whether additional CRT is given; (2) catch-up growth occurs immediately after cessation of treatment; (3) intensive chemotherapy alone significantly decreases height in the long-term but to a lesser extent than with additional CRT; (4) young children develop more severe height loss; (5) girls are reported to have greater height deficits but confounding factors have not been adequately considered; (6) late growth hormone (GH) deficiency has been detected in many children, mostly in those who had CRT; (7) GH replacement therapy seems to be effective.

We report survival outcomes of patients treated with high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) at Indiana University between 2004 and 2014. Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of 364 consecutive patients with GCT who progressed after cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy and were subsequently treated with HDCT and PBSCT. Three hundred forty-one patients received two consecutive courses of HDCT consisting of 700 mg/m2 carboplatin and 750 mg/m2 etoposide, each for 3 consecutive days, and each followed by PBSCT. Twenty-three patients received only a single course of HDCT because of progressive disease or toxicity. Cox proportional hazards models were used to test predictors of disease progression. Results The median age was 32 years (range, 17 to 70 years). With a median follow-up of 3.3 years, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 60% (95% CI, 55% to 65%) and the 2-year overall survival was 66% (95% CI, 60% to 70%). Three hundred three patients received HDCT as second-line therapy with a 2-year PFS of 63% (95% CI, 57% to 68%), and 61 patients received HDCT as third-line or later therapy with a 2-year PFS of 49% (95% CI, 36% to 61%). In a multivariable analysis, factors associated with disease progression included use of HDCT as third-line or later therapy, platinum-refractory disease, mediastinal primary tumor site, nonseminoma histology, intermediate- or poor-risk disease at the time of GCT diagnosis, and human chorionic gonadotropin \u2265 1,000 mIU/mL at initiation of HDCT. There were nine treatment-related deaths. Secondary leukemia developed in five patients. Conclusion This large single-institution study demonstrates that patients with relapsed metastatic GCT are curable by HDCT plus PBSCT even when used in third-line or later therapy."

        "paragraph_text": "Astroblastoma (AB) is a rare CNS tumor demonstrating abundant astroblastomatous pseudorosettes. Its molecular features have not been comprehensively studied and its status as a tumor entity is controversial. We analyzed a cohort of 27 histologically-defined ABs using DNA methylation profiling, copy number analysis, FISH and site-directed sequencing. Most cases demonstrated mutually exclusive MN1 rearrangements (n\u00a0=\u200910) or BRAFV600E mutations (n\u00a0=\u20097). Two additional cases harbored RELA rearrangements. Other cases lacked these specific genetic alterations (n\u00a0=\u20098). By DNA methylation profiling, tumors with MN1 or RELA rearrangement clustered with high-grade neuroepithelial tumor with MN1 alteration (HGNET-MN1) and RELA-fusion ependymoma, respectively. In contrast, BRAFV600E-mutant tumors grouped with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA). Six additional tumors clustered with either supratentorial pilocytic astrocytoma and ganglioglioma (LGG-PA/GG-ST), normal or reactive cerebrum, or with no defined DNA methylation class. While certain histologic features favored one genetic group over another, no group could be reliably distinguished by histopathology alone. Survival analysis between genetic AB subtypes was limited by sample size, but showed that MN1-rearranged AB tumors were characterized by better overall survival compared to other genetic subtypes, in fact, significantly better than BRAFV600E-mutant tumors (P\u00a0=\u20090.013). Our data confirm that histologically-defined ABs are molecularly heterogeneous and do not represent a single entity. They rather encompass several low- to higher-grade glial tumors including neuroepithelial tumors with MN1 rearrangement, PXA-like tumors, RELA ependymomas, and possibly yet uncharacterized lesions. Genetic subtyping of tumors exhibiting AB histology, particularly determination of MN1 and BRAFV600E status, is necessary for important prognostic and possible treatment implications."

        "paragraph_text": "Thyroid cancer, the commonest of endocrine malignancies, continues increasing in incidence being the 5th more prevalent cancer among women in the United States in 2012. Familial thyroid cancer has become a well-recognized, unique, clinical entity in patients with thyroid cancer originating from follicular cells, that is, nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma. Hereditary nonmedullary thyroid cancer may occur as a minor component of familial cancer syndromes (familial adenomatous polyposis, Gardner's syndrome, Cowden's disease, Carney's complex type 1, Werner's syndrome, and papillary renal neoplasia) or as a primary feature (familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer [FNMTC]). Although there is some controversy, some epidemiologic and clinical kindred studies have shown that FNMTC is associated with more aggressive disease than sporadic cases, with higher rates of multicentric tumours, lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal invasion, and shorter disease-free survival. This way, preventing screening will allow earlier detection, more timely intervention, and hopefully improved outcomes for patients and their families. On the other hand, in the last years, an important number of genetic studies on FNMTC have been published, trying to determine its genetic contribution. However, the genetic inheritance of FNMTC remains unclear; but it is believed to be autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. This paper provides an extensive overview of FNMTC from several points of view. Firstly, the impact of early detection on prognosis, secondly, the management and follow-up of FNMTC patients, and finally, the role of susceptibility loci, microRNAs (miRNAs) and telomerases in recently identified isolated cases of FNMTC."

        "paragraph_text": "Inorganic arsenic (iAs) in drinking water varies geographically and is prevalent worldwide. While exposures in the US are generally low, there are some areas with higher levels of naturally occurring iAs (potentially >100\u03bcg/L) where residents rely on unregulated drinking water wells. Much of the evidence on the association between iAs and cancer comes from epidemiological studies conducted in South American and Asian populations. These populations have generally been exposed to much higher levels of iAs and have differing underlying characteristics, both of which make comparing them to Western populations difficult. A key question is whether and how one should extrapolate from these high exposure studies to estimate cancer risk at lower exposures. We conducted an independent analysis to determine the most appropriate cancer endpoints, studies, and models to support an oral carcinogenicity assessment of iAs, taking into consideration factors that affect the apparent potency of iAs across geographically and culturally distinct populations. We identified bladder and lung cancer as high-priority endpoints and used meta-regression to pool data across studies from different regions of the world to derive oral cancer slope factors (CSFs) and unit risks (excess risk per \u03bcg/L) for iAs based on the background risks of bladder and lung cancer in the US. We also calculated concentrations of iAs in water that are not likely to result in cancer risk above what is considered acceptable by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). While we derived these factors assuming a linear, no-threshold relationship between iAs and cancer risk, we also evaluated the shape of the dose-response curves and assessed the evidence for overall nonlinearity. Overall, we found that the incremental risks of bladder and lung cancer associated with iAs were relatively low. The sensitivity analyses we conducted suggested that populations with relatively high iAs exposures appeared to drive the pooled cancer risk estimates, but many of our other tested assumptions did not substantially alter these estimates. Finally, we found that the mode of action evidence supports there being a threshold, but making a robust quantitative demonstration of a threshold using epidemiological data is difficult. When considered in the context of typical exposure levels in the US, our potency estimates indicate that iAs-induced cancer risk is much lower than observed bladder and lung cancer incidences. This suggests that the low iAs levels to which much of the general US population is exposed likely do not result in substantial additional cancer risk."

The available data has not described the population-based epidemiological features of CUP among AYA. Therefore, we collected patient information from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry, 1990-2015. Age, gender, ethnic, five pathological classification groups were assessed along with an aggregate level socioeconomic status (SES) index and population density at the county level. Incidence rates, modeled relative risks and survival of AYA patients with CUP were assessed. Among 2,480 AYA patients, 907 met the definition of standard pathology classifications. The majority of AYA patients with CUP had a neuroendocrine, squamous cell and poorly differentiated carcinomas with 0.4 cases per 1,000,000 population. AYA living in areas with the highest SES level had the highest risks of CUP; adjusted relative risks (ARR) of 1.17 (95% CI 1.0-1.4) and 1.99 (95% CI 1.5-2.6), respectively. AYA living in nonmetropolitan areas had a lower risk of CUP (ARR = 0.16; 95% CI 0.1-0.2). The incidence of differentiated neoplasms has been decreasing slower than undifferentiated neoplasms since the early 1990s. The median overall survival (OS) was 11\u2009months (95% CI 9-13\u2009months) with squamous CUP having the longest median OS 16\u2009years (95% CI 3-24\u2009years). In conclusion, this analysis answers several gaps in the knowledge of CUP among AYA and provides a platform to better understand this disease and its management within this group."

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This post-hoc one-shot data collection done 4 years after last data cutoff included patients who were alive at the time of the primary analysis and updated long-term patient status by including dates for first local progression, metastatic disease diagnosis, or death (if any of these had occurred) or the date of the last tumour evaluation or last PSA measurement.

We asked all 32\u2008976 women who attended the programme in Bergen in 2016-17, to participate in this randomised, controlled trial with a parallel group design. A study-specific software was developed to allocate women to either digital breast tomosynthesis or digital mammography using a 1:1 simple randomisation method based on participants' unique national identity numbers. The interviewing radiographer did the randomisation by entering the number into the software. Randomisation was done after consent and was therefore concealed from both the women and the radiographer at the time of consent; the algorithm was not disclosed to radiographers during the recruitment period. All data needed for analyses were complete 12 months after the recruitment period ended. The primary outcome measure was screen-detected breast cancer, stratified by screening technique (ie, digital breast tomosynthesis and digital mammography). A log-binomial regression model was used to estimate the efficacy of digital breast tomosynthesis versus digital mammography, defined as the crude risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs for screen-detected breast cancer for women screened during the recruitment period. A per-protocol approach was used in the analyses. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02835625, and is closed to accrual.",

Methods To define the prevalence of these germline mutations in patients with apparently sporadic pancreatic cancer, we sequenced 32 genes, including known pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes, in DNA prepared from normal tissue obtained from 854 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 288 patients with other pancreatic and periampullary neoplasms, and 51 patients with non-neoplastic diseases who underwent pancreatic resection at Johns Hopkins Hospital between 2000 and 2015. Results Thirty-three (3.9%; 95% CI, 3.0% to 5.8%) of 854 patients with pancreatic cancer had a deleterious germline mutation, 31 (3.5%) of which affected known familial pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes: BRCA2 (12 patients), ATM (10 patients), BRCA1 (3 patients), PALB2 (2 patients), MLH1 (2 patients), CDKN2A (1 patient), and TP53 (1 patient). Patients with these germline mutations were younger than those without (mean \u00b1 SD, 60.8 \u00b1 10.6 v 65.1 \u00b1 10.5 years; P = .03). Deleterious germline mutations were also found in BUB1B (1) and BUB3 (1). Only three of these 33 patients had reported a family history of pancreatic cancer, and most did not have a cancer family history to suggest an inherited cancer syndrome. Five (1.7%) of 288 patients with other periampullary neoplasms also had a deleterious germline mutation. Conclusion Germline mutations in pancreatic cancer susceptibility genes are commonly identified in patients with pancreatic cancer without a significant family history of cancer. These deleterious pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene mutations, some of which are therapeutically targetable, will be missed if current family history guidelines are the main criteria used to determine the appropriateness of gene testing."

The nonsynonymous RET polymorphism G691S has been reported as associated with MTC, but findings are discordant. We sought to clarify the role of G691S in MTCs through in silico analysis, genetic association in our patients and a meta-analysis with extensive literature revision. Ninety-three Italian patients were compared to 85 healthy individuals. Results were included in a meta-analysis together with 11 case-control association studies identified through PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science, with a combined sample of 968 cases and 2,115 controls. No association of G691S with MTC was found in our sample; however, we observed an excess of homozygotes for the variant, significantly higher among females. The overall allelic association in the meta-analysis was significant under the fixed-effect model (odds ratio [OR] = 1.22 [95% confidence intervals: 1.06-1.39], p = 0.0049), but borderline under the random effect model (OR = 1.21 [0.99-1.46], p = 0.0575), with a moderate/high heterogeneity (I(2) = 44.6%, p = 0.047). Under the recessive model of transmission, applied to the eight studies with available genotype frequencies, results were significant under both effect models (OR = 2.016 and OR = 2.022, p = 0.0004). No heterogeneity was anymore detectable. In silico analyses on G691S confirmed a change of the phosphorylation pattern that might account for the enhanced signaling transduction previously reported for G691S in several cancers, thus also explaining its overrepresentation in MTCs. The G691S variant allele does increase the risk for MTC, with a recessive mechanism of action, apparently more evident among females."

        "paragraph_text": "In 2012, an international consensus paper reported that medulloblastoma comprises four molecular subgroups (WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4), each associated with distinct genomic features and clinical behavior. Independently, multiple recent reports have defined further intra-subgroup heterogeneity in the form of biologically and clinically relevant subtypes. However, owing to differences in patient cohorts and analytical methods, estimates of subtype number and definition have been inconsistent, especially within Group 3 and Group 4. Herein, we aimed to reconcile the definition of Group 3/Group 4\u00a0MB subtypes through the analysis of a series of 1501 medulloblastomas with DNA-methylation profiling data, including 852 with matched transcriptome data. Using multiple complementary bioinformatic approaches, we compared the concordance of subtype calls between published cohorts and analytical methods, including assessments of class-definition confidence and reproducibility. While the lowest complexity solutions continued to support the original consensus subgroups of Group 3 and Group 4, our analysis most strongly supported a definition comprising eight robust Group 3/Group 4 subtypes (types I-VIII). Subtype II was consistently identified across all component studies, while all others were supported by multiple class-definition methods. Regardless of analytical technique, increasing cohort size did not further increase the number of identified Group 3/Group 4 subtypes. Summarizing the molecular and clinico-pathological features of these eight subtypes indicated enrichment of specific driver gene alterations and cytogenetic events amongst subtypes, and identified highly disparate survival outcomes, further supporting their biological and clinical relevance. Collectively, this study provides continued support for consensus Groups 3 and 4 while enabling robust derivation of, and categorical accounting for, the extensive intertumoral heterogeneity within Groups 3 and 4, revealed by recent high-resolution subclassification approaches. Furthermore, these findings provide a basis for application of emerging methods (e.g., proteomics/single-cell approaches) which may additionally inform medulloblastoma subclassification. Outputs from this study will help shape definition of the next generation of medulloblastoma clinical protocols and facilitate the application of enhanced molecularly guided risk stratification to improve outcomes and quality of life for patients and their families."

Routine screening is proposed to detect and localize neuroendocrine manifestations as early as possible. The goal is timely intervention to improve quality of life and to increase life expectancy by preventing the development of life-threatening hormonal syndromes and/or metastatic disease. In recent years, some studies compared different and new imaging methods regarding their sensitivity and utility in MEN1 patients. This present article reviews the proposed diagnostic tools for MEN1 screening as well as potential future perspectives."

Follow-up visits occurred every 4 weeks up to week 16, and at 1 year. The primary outcome was time to first febrile episode or death from all causes within the first 12 weeks of trial treatment.

        "paragraph_text": "The connection between cancer and circadian rhythms has garnered recent attention. BMAL1 is a core factor in the regulation of circadian rhythms, and its variants have frequently been associated with human diseases, including cancer. Our study first clarifies the relationship of three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs3816360, rs2290035, and rs3816358) in BMAL1 with the risk of lung cancer, as well as the gene-environment interaction between the polymorphisms and tobacco exposure in a Northeast Chinese population. A case-control study of 409 new diagnosis patients and 417 controls was performed in Shenyang, Liaoning province. The gene-environment interactions were explored on both additive and multiplicative scale. After Bonferroni correction, rs3816360 and rs2290035 were evidently associated with lung cancer risk. For rs3816360, subjects carrying CC (adjusted odds ratio [OR]\u2009=\u20092.163, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u2009=\u20091.413-3.310, p\u2009=\u20090.004) genotype showed an increased risk of lung cancer compared to the subjects carrying homozygous TT genotype. As for rs2290035, homozygous carriers of AA genotype (OR\u2009=\u20091.908, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.207-3.017, p\u2009=\u20090.006) showed a significantly increased risk of lung cancer. The dominant models and recessive models of rs3816360 and rs2290035 showed significant associations (p\u2009<\u20090.01). In the stratified analysis, our results revealed that rs3816360 and rs2290035 were associated with the risk of lung adenocarcinoma. However, rs3816358 polymorphism was not significantly associated with lung cancer risk. The measures of additive interaction and logistic models suggested that the gene-environment interactions were not statistically significant on both additive and multiplicative scales."

This study tested whether genetic variability in SLC22A3 associates with pancreatic cancer risk and prognosis. Twenty four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging the SLC22A3 gene sequence and regulatory elements were selected for analysis. Of these, 22 were successfully evaluated in the discovery phase while six significant or suggestive variants entered the validation phase, comprising a total study number of 1,518 cases and 3,908 controls. In the discovery phase, rs2504938, rs9364554, and rs2457571 SNPs were significantly associated with pancreatic cancer risk. Moreover, rs7758229 associated with the presence of distant metastases, while rs512077 and rs2504956 correlated with overall survival of patients. Although replicated, the association for rs9364554 did not pass multiple testing corrections in the validation phase. Contrary to the discovery stage, rs2504938 associated with survival in the validation cohort, which was more pronounced in stage IV patients. In conclusion, common variation in the SLC22A3 gene is unlikely to significantly contribute to pancreatic cancer risk. The rs2504938 SNP in SLC22A3 significantly associates with an unfavorable prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. Further investigation of this SNP effect on the molecular and clinical phenotype is warranted."

Tumor recurrence occurred in 43 of 244 irradiated metastases (18%). The 5-year LC rate of treated metastatic sites was 81%.

Compared to children with ALL and no DS (non-DS-ALL), those with DS and ALL (DS-ALL) harbor uncommon genetic alterations, suggesting DS-ALL could have distinct biological features. Recent studies have implicated several genes on chromosome 21 in DS-ALL, but the precise mechanisms predisposing children with DS to ALL remain unknown. Our integrated genetic/epigenetic analysis revealed that DS-ALL was highly heterogeneous with many subtypes. Although each subtype had genetic/epigenetic profiles similar to those found in non-DS-ALL, the subtype distribution differed significantly between groups. The Philadelphia chromosome-like subtype, a high-risk B-cell lineage variant relatively rare among the entire pediatric ALL population, was the most common form in DS-ALL. Hypermethylation of RUNX1 on chromosome 21 was also found in DS-ALL, but not non-DS-ALL. RUNX1 is essential for differentiation of blood cells, especially B cells; thus, hypermethylation of the RUNX1 promoter in B-cell precursors might be associated with increased incidence of B-cell precursor ALL in DS patients."

With rapid development of CAR-T therapies, a systematic method is needed to identify and monitor symptoms of neurotoxicity, elucidate potential etiologies, and compare toxicity across trials. This paper presents a systematic evaluation developed and used to prospectively assess neurotoxicity in our phase I anti-CD22 CAR-T-cell trial and describes the symptoms of neurotoxicity identified using this methodology. Central nervous system (CNS) studies included routine lumbar punctures performed for disease evaluation pretherapy and posttherapy and a baseline brain MRI. Brief cognitive evaluations, assessing 4 domains (attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and processing speed), were administered preinfusion and postinfusion. A newly developed CAR-T-specific neurological symptom checklist (NSC) was completed by caregivers at 3 designated time-points. Serial serum cytokine levels were compared with neurotoxicity symptoms and severity. The majority of the first 22 consecutively treated subjects (ages, 7-30) demonstrated stable or improved cognitive test scores following therapy and no irreversible neurotoxicity, despite CAR-T-related antileukemic response, cytokine release syndrome, and trafficking of CAR-T cells to the CSF. The NSC allowed us to document the type and timing of symptoms and explore the etiology of neurotoxicity associated with CD22 CAR-T therapy. Cytokine profiling demonstrated that more concerning symptoms of neurotoxicity, such as hallucination and disorientation, were significantly associated with higher serum cytokine levels, supporting the hypothesis of inflammation-driven neurotoxicity. Systematic assessments of neurotoxicity were feasible in acutely ill children and young adults and served to characterize and monitor the symptoms associated with CAR-T therapy. We recommend these evaluations be incorporated into future immunotherapy protocols."

However, by virtue of their disease and its treatments, childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk for a wide range of serious health conditions, including disorders of the endocrine system. Recent data indicate that 40% to 50% of survivors will develop an endocrine disorder during their lifetime. Risk factors for endocrine complications include both host (e.g., age, sex) and treatment factors (e.g., radiation). Radiation exposure to key endocrine organs (e.g., hypothalamus, pituitary, thyroid, and gonads) places cancer survivors at the highest risk of developing an endocrine abnormality over time; these endocrinopathies can develop decades following cancer treatment, underscoring the importance of lifelong surveillance. The following guideline addresses the diagnosis and treatment of hypothalamic-pituitary and growth disorders commonly encountered in childhood cancer survivors.",

Both inherited high-penetrance mutations in BRCA2 (ref. 2), ATM, PALB2 (ref. 4), BRCA1 (ref. 5), STK11 (ref. 6), CDKN2A and mismatch-repair genes and low-penetrance loci are associated with increased risk. To identify new risk loci, we performed a genome-wide association study on 9,925 pancreatic cancer cases and 11,569 controls, including 4,164 newly genotyped cases and 3,792 controls in 9 studies from North America, Central Europe and Australia. We identified three newly associated regions: 17q25.1 (LINC00673, rs11655237, odds ratio (OR) = 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-1.34, P = 1.42 \u00d7 10(-14)), 7p13 (SUGCT, rs17688601, OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.84-0.92, P = 1.41 \u00d7 10(-8)) and 3q29 (TP63, rs9854771, OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.85-0.93, P = 2.35 \u00d7 10(-8)). We detected significant association at 2p13.3 (ETAA1, rs1486134, OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.09-1.19, P = 3.36 \u00d7 10(-9)), a region with previous suggestive evidence in Han Chinese. We replicated previously reported associations at 9q34.2 (ABO), 13q22.1 (KLF5), 5p15.33 (TERT and CLPTM1), 13q12.2 (PDX1), 1q32.1 (NR5A2), 7q32.3 (LINC-PINT), 16q23.1 (BCAR1) and 22q12.1 (ZNRF3).

        "paragraph_text": "The usefulness of mechanistic models to disentangle complex multiscale cancer processes, such as treatment response, has been widely acknowledged. However, a major barrier for multiscale models to predict treatment outcomes in individual patients lies in their initialization and parametrization, which needs to reflect individual cancer characteristics accurately. In this study, we use multitype measurements acquired routinely on a single breast tumor, including histopathology, MRI, and molecular profiling, to personalize parts of a complex multiscale model of breast cancer treated with chemotherapeutic and antiangiogenic agents. The model accounts for drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We developed an open-source computer program that simulates cross-sections of tumors under 12-week therapy regimens and used it to individually reproduce and elucidate treatment outcomes of 4 patients. Two of the tumors did not respond to therapy, and model simulations were used to suggest alternative regimens with improved outcomes dependent on the tumor's individual characteristics. It was determined that more frequent and lower doses of chemotherapy reduce tumor burden in a low proliferative tumor while lower doses of antiangiogenic agents improve drug penetration in a poorly perfused tumor. Furthermore, using this model, we were able to correctly predict the outcome in another patient after 12 weeks of treatment. In summary, our model bridges multitype clinical data to shed light on individual treatment outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE: Mathematical modeling is used to validate possible mechanisms of tumor growth, resistance, and treatment outcome."

        "paragraph_text": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States and the 12th most common worldwide. Mortality is high, largely due to late stage of presentation and suboptimal treatment regimens. Approximately 10% of PC cases have a familial basis. The major genetic defect has yet to be identified but may be inherited by an autosomal dominant pattern with reduced penetrance. Several known hereditary syndromes or genes are associated with an increased risk of developing PC and account for approximately 2% of PCs. These syndromes include the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma, Lynch syndrome, familial polyposis, ataxia-telangiectasia, and hereditary pancreatitis. Appropriate screening using methods such as biomarkers or imaging, with endoscopic ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, may assist in the early detection of neoplastic lesions in the high-risk population. If these lesions are detected and treated before the development of invasive carcinoma, PC disease morbidity and mortality may be improved. This review will focus on familial PC and other hereditary syndromes implicated in the increased risk of PC; it will also highlight current screening methods and the future of new screening modalities."

        "paragraph_text": "Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER/EGFR) is associated with various tumors, including ependymomas. To investigate whether EGFR inhibition was of benefit in pediatric patients with recurrent ependymoma, a multi-center, randomized, open-label, phase 2 study of oral erlotinib versus oral etoposide was undertaken. Twenty-five patients were randomized to receive erlotinib 85\u00a0mg/m(2) daily or etoposide 50\u00a0mg/m(2)/day for 21 consecutive days followed by a 7-day rest period. Courses were repeated every 28\u00a0days. In the erlotinib arm, no patient achieved a complete, partial, or minor response, and only 2 (15.4\u2009%) patients showed stable disease as their best response. In the etoposide arm, 2 patients (16.7\u2009%) demonstrated partial responses, 1 (8.3\u2009%) patient demonstrated a minor response, and 2 (16.7\u2009%) showed prolonged stable disease, for a prolonged disease control rate of 41.7\u2009%. Three patients received at least nine cycles of etoposide (range 9-24 cycles) before discontinuing at the request of the physician and/or family. Four patients who failed etoposide in this study received erlotinib in a companion single arm study; none had a response. The futility criteria were met at the second interim analysis, and both studies were discontinued. Pharmacokinetics of erlotinib were similar to previous observations in pediatric patients. Overall, erlotinib was well tolerated and safety was consistent with its established profile in adults. The overall risk-benefit profile does not support the use of erlotinib in pediatric patients with recurrent ependymoma, whereas single-agent etoposide appears to have efficacy in a subset of patients."

This corresponds to 115 fewer deaths (191 fewer to 38 fewer) per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab at 12 months. We downgraded the certainty of evidence one level for imprecision.Pembrolizumab may slightly improve quality of life (change from baseline to week 15 assessed with the Core Quality of Life Questionnaire; higher value reflects better quality of life; scale 0 to 100) with a mean difference (MD) of 9.05, 95% CI 4.61 to 13.50; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision.Secondary outcomesPembrolizumab may have little or no effect on disease progression (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to three fewer patients (42 fewer to 24 more) whose disease progressed per 1000 participants at 12 months. We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision.Pembrolizumab probably improves treatment response (based on complete or partial radiologic response) with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.85, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.77; moderate certainty evidence). This corresponds to 97 more respondents (27 more to 202 more) per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab. We downgraded the certainty of evidence one level for imprecision.Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on treatment-related mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.79; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to one fewer (12 fewer to 44 more) treatment-related deaths per 1000 participants with pembrolizumab. We downgraded the certainty of evidence two levels for study limitations and imprecision.Pembrolizumab may have little or no effect on discontinuations due to adverse events (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.10). This corresponds to 54 fewer discontinuations per 1000 participants (95% CI 79 fewer to 7 more). We downgraded the certainty of evidence for study limitations and imprecision.Pembrolizumab may reduce serious adverse events (RR 0.83, 95 CI 0.72 to 0.97; low certainty evidence). This corresponds to 107 fewer serious averse events per 1000 participants (95% CI 19 fewer to 176 fewer). We downgraded two levels for study limitations and imprecision.",

We are very uncertain about the effects of pembolizumab on quality of life. Pembolizumab may also improve treatment response rates, and reduce the risk of serious adverse events, but may make little or no difference to discontinuations of treatment due to adverse events.

We aimed to determine CIPN prevalence, risk factors, and association with psychological distress and falls among long-term breast cancer survivors. We conducted Cross-sectional analyses among postmenopausal women with a history of stage I-III breast cancer who received taxane-based chemotherapy. Participants reported neuropathic symptoms of tingling/numbness in hands and/or feet on a 0-10 numerical rating scale. We conducted multivariate logistic regression analyses to evaluate risk factors associated with the presence of CIPN and the relationship between CIPN and anxiety, depression, insomnia, and patient-reported falls. Among 296 participants, 173 (58.4\u00a0%) reported CIPN symptoms, 91 (30.7\u00a0%) rated their symptoms as mild, and 82 (27.7\u00a0%) rated them moderate to severe. Compared with women of normal weight, being obese was associated with increased risk of CIPN (adjusted OR 1.94, 95\u00a0% CI: 1.03-3.65).\u00a0Patients with CIPN reported greater insomnia severity, anxiety, and depression than those without (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Severity of CIPN was associated with higher rates of falls, with 23.8, 31.9, and 41.5\u00a0% in the \"no CIPN,\" \"mild,\" and \"moderate-to-severe\" groups, respectively, experiencing falls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028). The majority of long-term breast cancer survivors who received taxane-based chemotherapy reported CIPN symptoms; obesity was a significant risk factor. Those with CIPN also reported increased psychological distress and falls. Interventions need to target CIPN and comorbid psychological symptoms, and incorporate fall prevention strategies for aging breast cancer survivors."

        "paragraph_text": "Background Image reconstruction thickness may impact quantitative coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) from lung cancer screening computed tomography (LCSCT), limiting its application in practice. Methods and Results We evaluated Agatston-based quantitative CACS from 1.25-mm LCSCT and cardiac computed tomography for agreement in 87 patients. We then evaluated Agatston-based quantitative CACS from 1.25-, 2.5-, and 5.0-mm slice thickness LCSCT for agreement in 258 patients. Secondary analysis included the impact of slice thickness on predictive value of 4-year outcomes. Median age of patients who underwent 1.25-mm LCSCT and cardiac computed tomography was 63 years (interquartile interval, 57, 68). CACS from 1.25-mm LCSCT and cardiac computed tomography demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation, R=0.9770 (0.965, 0.985), with good agreement. The receiver operating characteristic curve areas under the curve for cardiac computed tomography and LCSCT were comparable at 0.8364 (0.6628, 1.01) and 0.8208 (0.6431, 0.9985), respectively ( P=0.733). Median age of patients who underwent LCSCT with 3 slice thicknesses was 66 years (interquartile interval, 63, 73). Compared with CACS from 1.25-mm scans, CACS from 2.5- and 5.0-mm scans demonstrated strong Pearson correlations, R=0.9949 (0.9935, 0.996) and R=0.9478 (0.9338, 0.959), respectively, though bias was largely negative for 5.0-mm scans. Receiver operating characteristic curve areas under the curve for 1.25-, 2.5-, and 5.0-mm scans were comparable at 0.7040 (0.6307, 0.7772), 0.7063 (0.6327, 0.7799), and 0.7194 (0.6407, 0.7887), respectively ( P=0.6487). When using individualized high-risk thresholds derived from respective receiver operating characteristic curves, all slice thicknesses demonstrated similar prognostic value. Conclusions Slice thickness is an important consideration when interpreting Agatston CACS from LCSCTs. Despite the absence of ECG gating, it appears reasonable to report CACS from either 1.25- or 2.5-mm slice thickness LCSCT to help stratify cardiovascular risk. Conversely, 5.0-mm scans largely underidentify calcium, limiting practical use within the established CACS values used to categorize cardiovascular risk."

To identify common susceptibility alleles, we performed the largest pancreatic cancer GWAS to date, including 9040 patients and 12,496 controls of European ancestry from the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan) and the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4). Here, we find significant evidence of a novel association at rs78417682 (7p12/TNS3, P\u2009=\u20094.35\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8). Replication of 10 promising signals in up to 2737 patients and 4752 controls from the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) consortium yields new genome-wide significant loci: rs13303010 at 1p36.33 (NOC2L, P\u2009=\u20098.36\u2009\u00d7\u200910-14), rs2941471 at 8q21.11 (HNF4G, P\u2009=\u20096.60\u2009\u00d7\u200910-10), rs4795218 at 17q12 (HNF1B, P\u2009=\u20091.32\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8), and rs1517037 at 18q21.32 (GRP, P\u2009=\u20093.28\u2009\u00d7\u200910-8). rs78417682 is not statistically significantly associated with pancreatic cancer in PANDoRA. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis in three independent pancreatic data sets provides molecular support of NOC2L as a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene."

Participants were case-case-matched CRC survivors with (n\u00a0=\u00a075) or without (n\u00a0=\u00a075) LS (mean age of 55; range: 27-93). Participants completed a mailed questionnaire assessing demographics, clinical characteristics, healthcare utilization, psychosocial variables, and provider satisfaction. LS CRC survivors reported lower provider satisfaction scores on three subscales of the Primary Care Assessment Survey: communication (78.14 vs. 83.96; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), interpersonal treatment (78.58 vs. 85.30; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and knowledge of the patient (60.34 vs. 69.86; P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Among LS CRC survivors, predictors for mean communication and trust subscale scores were location of treatment and socioeconomic status. Higher mean depression scores also were associated with trust, while social support predicted higher satisfaction with communication. Sporadic CRC survivor satisfaction is driven largely by age (communication, interpersonal treatment) and patient anxiety (communication), while seeing a provider more often was associated with increased satisfaction with knowledge of the patient. LS CRC survivors reported lower levels of provider satisfaction than sporadic CRC survivors. LS survivors who received care at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, a comprehensive cancer center (CCC), reported higher satisfaction than those receiving care at other institutions. Depressive symptoms and socioeconomic status may impact provider satisfaction ratings. Exploration of other potential predictors of provider satisfaction should be examined in this population. Additionally, further research is needed to examine the potential impact of provider satisfaction on adherence to medical recommendations in LS CRC survivors, particularly those being treated outside of CCCs."

Patients were excluded if they were refractory to previous treatment with an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either isatuximab 10 mg/kg plus pomalidomide 4 mg plus dexamethasone 40 mg (20 mg for patients aged \u226575 years), or pomalidomide 4 mg plus dexamethasone 40 mg. Randomisation was done using interactive response technology and stratified according to the number of previous lines of treatment (2-3 vs >3) and age (<75 years vs \u226575 years). Treatments were assigned based on a permuted blocked randomisation scheme with a block size of four. The isatuximab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone group received isatuximab intravenously on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in the first 28-day cycle, then on days 1 and 15 in subsequent cycles. Both groups received oral pomalidomide on days 1 to 21 in each cycle, and oral or intravenous dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Dose reductions for adverse reactions were permitted for pomalidomide and dexamethasone, but not for isatuximab. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, determined by an independent response committee and assessed in the intention-to-treat population.

She underwent initial debulking craniotomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as having intravenous vitamin C infusions 2\u207b3 times weekly over the four years from diagnosis. Her progress was monitored by blood tests, regular computerised tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, clinical reviews and European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaires (EORTC QLQ C30).

The incidence of these late effects including cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), lacunar lesions, vascular occlusive disease including moyamoya syndrome, vascular malformations, and hemorrhage is not well known. This article reviews the preclinical findings regarding the pathophysiology of late radiation-induced vascular damage, and discusses the clinical incidence and risk factors for each type of vasculopathy. The pathophysiology is complex and dependent on the targeted blood vessels, and upregulation of pro-inflammatory and hypoxia-related genes. The risk factors for adult CVAs are similar to those for patients not exposed to cranial radiotherapy. For children, risks for late vascular complications include young age at radiotherapy, radiotherapy dose, NF1, tumor location, chemotherapy, and endocrine abnormalities. The incidence of late vascular complications of radiotherapy may be impacted by improved technology, therapeutic interventions, and appropriate follow up."

In a two-stage study, we analyzed the existing genome-wide association study dataset of 868 pancreatic cancer patients from MD Anderson Cancer Center in relation to overall survival using Cox regression. Top hits were selected for replication in another 820 patients from the same institution using the Taqman genotyping method. Functional annotation, pathway analysis and gene expression analysis were conducted using existing software and databases. We discovered genome-wide significant associations of patient survival with three imputed SNPs which, in complete LD (r2 \u2009=\u20091), were intronic SNPs of the PAIP2B (rs113988120) and DYSF genes (rs112493246 and rs138529893) located on Chromosome 2. The variant alleles were associated with a 3.06-fold higher risk of death [95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20092.10-4.47, p=6.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-9] after adjusting for clinical factors. Eleven SNPs were tested in the replication study and the association of rs113988120 with survival was confirmed (hazard ratio: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.13-2.20, \u00a0p=0.008). In silico analysis found rs1139988120 might lead to altered motif. This locus is in LD (D'\u2009=\u20090.77) with three eQTL SNPs near or belong to the NAGK and MCEE genes. According to The Cancer Genome Atlas data and our previous RNA-sequencing data, the mRNA expression level of PAIP2B but not NAGK, MCEE or DYSF was significantly lower in pancreatic tumors than in normal adjacent tissues. Additional validation efforts and functional studies are warranted to demonstrate whether PAIP2B is a novel tumor suppressor gene and a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer."

The precision medicine approach to low-dose computed tomography screening assesses subjects' benefits versus harms based on their personal lung cancer risk, where harms include false-positive screens and resultant invasive procedures. We assess the relationship between lung cancer risk and the rate of false-positive LDCT screens. Methods The National Lung Screening Trial randomized high-risk subjects to three annual screens with low-dose computed tomography or chest radiographs. Following the completion of National Lung Screening Trial, the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) classification system was developed and retrospectively applied to National Lung Screening Trial low-dose computed tomography findings. The rate of false-positive screens (by Lung-RADS) and the resultant invasive procedures were examined as a function of lung cancer risk estimated by a model. Results Of 26,722 subjects randomized to the low-dose computed tomography arm, 26,309 received a baseline screen and were included in the analysis. The proportion with any false positive over three screening rounds increased from 12.9% to 25.9% from lowest to highest risk decile, and the proportion with an invasive procedure following a false positive also significantly increased from 0.7% to 2.0% from lowest to highest risk decile. Conclusion These findings indicate a need for personalized low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening decision aids to accurately convey the benefits to harm trade-off."

        "paragraph_text": "Different epidemiological studies have indicated conflicting information about the association of induced abortion (IA) with breast cancer risk. A recent meta-analysis with prospective evidences did not support the positive association between IA and breast cancer risk. Thus, we in our meta-analysis study have tried to analyze this specific association.We searched all relevant articles from an English-language literature using Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane databases, until December 10, 2016. All the statistical analyses were performed on case-control studies, using Review Manager Software 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK).Our meta-analysis results based on 25 studies, including 5 studies with Chinese patients, indicated that there was no association of IA with breast cancer (OR\u200a=\u200a1.08, 95% CI 0.98-1.19, P\u200a=\u200a.1). However, significant heterogeneity was observed, and thus further subgroup analyses were conducted. The combined OR of subjects with only 1-time IA was 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.18, P\u200a=\u200a.63, while for subjects with 2 or more IAs, it was 1.06, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30, P\u200a=\u200a.58. In addition, the ORs of subjects, with 1st IA age either less than 30 or older than 30, were 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26, P\u200a=\u200a.59, and 1.18, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.49, P\u200a=\u200a.17, respectively. These observations indicated that number of IAs and the age of 1st IA were not associated with breast cancer risk. Due to lack of dose-response relationships, it is difficult to say if number of IAs contributed into statistical heterogeneity. But after subgroup analysis, the age at the 1st IA appeared to impact the statistical heterogeneity. The different reproductive history appears to account for the high heterogeneity among individual studies. Also analysis of nulliparous women showed no significant difference in the association of IA and breast cancer (OR\u200a=\u200a1.02, 95% CI 0.86-1.21, P\u200a=\u200a.85). However, parous women had higher IA rate in case group than control group (OR\u200a=\u200a1.11, 95% CI 1.02-1.20, P\u200a=\u200a.01). Ethnicities might also result in high heterogeneity; thus, we conducted subgroup analyses on Chinese subjects, importantly, with 5 studies having Chinese patients, and did not observe any difference in the incidence of IA and its association with breast cancer between case and control groups (OR\u200a=\u200a1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.13, P\u200a=\u200a.21).After subgroup analysis, our study showed that IA might increase the risk of breast cancer in parous women, but in the nulliparous, IA was not significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer."

The higher frequency of some subtypes such as LBCL with IRF4 rearrangement (LBCL-IRF4) in children suggests that some age-related biological differences may exist. To characterize the genetic and molecular heterogeneity of these tumors, we studied 31 diffuse LBCLs (DLBCLs), not otherwise specified (NOS); 20 LBCL-IRF4 cases; and 12 cases of high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL), NOS in patients \u226425 years using an integrated approach, including targeted gene sequencing, copy-number arrays, and gene expression profiling. Each subgroup displayed different molecular profiles. LBCL-IRF4 had frequent mutations in IRF4 and NF-\u03baB pathway genes (CARD11, CD79B, and MYD88), losses of 17p13 and gains of chromosome 7, 11q12.3-q25, whereas DLBCL, NOS was predominantly of germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype and carried gene mutations similar to the adult counterpart (eg, SOCS1 and KMT2D), gains of 2p16/REL, and losses of 19p13/CD70. A subset of HGBCL, NOS displayed recurrent alterations of Burkitt lymphoma-related genes such as MYC, ID3, and DDX3X and homozygous deletions of 9p21/CDKN2A, whereas other cases were genetically closer to GCB DLBCL. Factors related to unfavorable outcome were age >18 years; activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL profile, HGBCL, NOS, high genetic complexity, 1q21-q44 gains, 2p16/REL gains/amplifications, 19p13/CD70 homozygous deletions, and TP53 and MYC mutations. In conclusion, these findings further unravel the molecular heterogeneity of pediatric and young adult LBCL, improve the classification of this group of tumors, and provide new parameters for risk stratification."

Women with stage I-III breast cancer scheduled to receive taxane therapy were randomized to receive a standardized protocol of 12 true or sham EA (SEA) weekly treatments concurrent with taxane treatment. Subjects completed the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Taxane neurotoxicity subscale (FACT-NTX), and other assessments at baseline and weeks 6, 12, and 16. A total of 180 subjects were screened, 63 enrolled and 48 completed week 16 assessments. Mean age was 50 with 25 % white, 25 % black, and 43 % Hispanic; 52 % had no prior chemotherapy. At week 12, both groups reported an increase in mean BPI-SF worst pain score, but no mean differences were found between groups (SEA 2.8 vs. EA 2.6, P = .86). By week 16, the SEA group returned to baseline, while the EA group continued to worsen (SEA 1.7 vs. EA 3.4, P = .03). The increase in BPI-SF worst pain score was 1.62 points higher in the EA group than in the SEA group at week 16 (P = .04). In a randomized, sham-controlled trial of EA for prevention of taxane-induced CIPN, there were no differences in pain or neuropathy between groups at week 12. Of concern, subjects on EA had a slower recovery than SEA subjects. Future studies should focus on EA for treatment as opposed to prevention of CIPN."

Driver mutations in EGFR, MET, BRAF, and TP53 were almost always clonal. However, heterogeneous driver alterations that occurred later in evolution were found in more than 75% of the tumors and were common in PIK3CA and NF1 and in genes that are involved in chromatin modification and DNA damage response and repair. Genome doubling and ongoing dynamic chromosomal instability were associated with intratumor heterogeneity and resulted in parallel evolution of driver somatic copy-number alterations, including amplifications in CDK4, FOXA1, and BCL11A. Elevated copy-number heterogeneity was associated with an increased risk of recurrence or death (hazard ratio, 4.9; P=4.4\u00d710-4), which remained significant in multivariate analysis.",

Patients who had histologically proven invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas, pathologically documented stage I-III, and no local residual or microscopic residual tumour, and were aged 20 years or older were eligible. Patients with resected pancreatic cancer were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive gemcitabine (1000 mg/m(2), intravenously administered on days 1, 8, and 15, every 4 weeks [one cycle], for up to six cycles) or S-1 (40 mg, 50 mg, or 60 mg according to body-surface area, orally administered twice a day for 28 days followed by a 14 day rest, every 6 weeks [one cycle], for up to four cycles) at the data centre by a modified minimisation method, balancing residual tumour status, nodal status, and institutions. The primary outcome was overall survival in the two treatment groups, assessed in the per-protocol population, excluding ineligible patients and those not receiving the allocated treatment. The protocol prespecified that the superiority of S-1 with respect to overall survival was also to be assessed in the per-protocol population by a log-rank test, if the non-inferiority of S-1 was verified. We estimated overall and relapse-free survival using the Kaplan-Meier methods, and assessed non-inferiority of S-1 to gemcitabine using the Cox proportional hazard model. The expected hazard ratio (HR) for mortality was 0.87 with a non-inferiority margin of 1.25 (power 80%; one-sided type I error 2.5%). This trial is registered at UMIN CTR (UMIN000000655).",

The per-protocol population therefore consisted of 190 patients in the gemcitabine group and 187 patients in the S-1 group. On Sept 15, 2012, following the recommendation from the independent data and safety monitoring committee, this study was discontinued because the prespecified criteria for early discontinuation were met at the interim analysis for efficacy, when all the protocol treatments had been finished. Analysis with the follow-up data on Jan 15, 2016, showed HR of mortality was 0.57 (95% CI 0.44-0.72, pnon-inferiority<0.0001, p<0.0001 for superiority), associated with 5-year overall survival of 24.4% (18.6-30.8) in the gemcitabine group and 44.1% (36.9-51.1) in the S-1 group.

Here, we report the results of a RAD51C mutational screening in a large series of German familial index patients negative for pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations and the in-vitro characterization of two novel exonic RAD51C splice-site mutations. A total of 610 index cases derived from BC/OC (n=587) or OC-only families (n=23) were screened for potentially deleterious germline mutations in RAD51C. The frequencies of two splice-site mutations were assessed by single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping in 1410 additional cases not enriched for OC family history. In three independent families, we identified novel splice-site mutations affecting the last nucleotide of exon 2 (c.404G>C, c.404G>T). Both mutations disrupt proper RAD51C pre-mRNA processing and cause a missense substitution immediately followed by a stop codon (p.Cys135Serfs*2; p.Cys135Leufs*2). Even though both mutations have similar effects on the protein level, they are associated with either BC/OC, OC-only, or BC-only family histories. The rare finding of a clearly truncating RAD51C mutation in an early-onset BC patient with a BC-only family history supports the notion that compromised RAD51C function may result in both BC and OC. Large international collaborative studies are needed to quantify the relative risk of RAD51C alterations for BC and to unravel the genetic modifying factors that determine phenotypic variability with respect to cancer site."

A significant correlation was found between Smad4/Dpc4 immunolabeling and tumor size (P = 0.006), lymphatic invasion (P = 0.033), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.006). Interestingly, all of the 6 patients demonstrating 5-year survival had intact SMAD4/DPC4. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that lymph node metastasis (P = 0.001), lymphatic invasion (P = 0.008), the tumor (T) factor (T3 vs. T1/T2, P = 0.004), loss of p16 immunolabeling (P = 0.029), and loss of Smad4/Dpc4 immunolabeling (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with shorter overall survival.

        "paragraph_text": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. In the past decade, significant advances have been made in the science of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Screening has been introduced with the goal of early detection. The National Lung Screening Trial found a lung cancer mortality benefit of 20% and a 6.7% decrease in all-cause mortality with the use of low-dose chest computed tomography in high-risk individuals. The treatment of lung cancer has also evolved with the introduction of several lines of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with EGFR, ALK, ROS1, and NTRK mutations. Similarly, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have dramatically changed the landscape of NSCLC treatment. Furthermore, the results of new trials continue to help us understand the role of these novel agents and which patients are more likely to benefit; ICIs are now part of the first-line NSCLC treatment armamentarium as monotherapy, combined with chemotherapy, or after definite chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III unresectable NSCLC. Expression of programmed cell death protein-ligand 1 in malignant cells has been studied as a potential biomarker for response to ICIs. However, important drawbacks exist that limit its discriminatory potential. Identification of accurate predictive biomarkers beyond programmed cell death protein-ligand 1 expression remains essential to select the most appropriate candidates for ICI therapy. Many questions remain unanswered regarding the proper sequence and combinations of these new agents; however, the field is moving rapidly, and the overall direction is optimistic."

Mutations in more than a dozen distinct susceptibility genes have implicated multiple pathways in these tumours, offering insights into kinase downstream signalling interactions and hypoxia regulation, and uncovering links between metabolism, epigenetic remodelling and cell growth. These advances extend to co-occurring tumours, including renal, thyroid and gastrointestinal malignancies. Hereditary pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are powerful models for recognizing cancer driver events, which can be harnessed for diagnostic purposes and for guiding the future development of targeted therapies."

Nonetheless, BRCA-testing in pancreatic cancer (PC) patients is not universally introduced in clinical practice. A retrospective analysis was conducted, firstly, to evaluate the rate of BRCA-positive families among those presenting a family history of PC besides breast and/or ovarian cancer. Secondly, the relationship between BRCA pathogenic variants and PC risk was evaluated. Finally, the characteristics of PC developed in BRCA families were described. Among 5143 family trees reporting breast and/or ovarian cancer cases, 392 showed a family history of PC. A total of 35 families (24.5% selected by the Modena Criteria and 21.3% by the NCCN Criteria) were positive to BRCA testing. Among the BRCA1 mutations, 36.8% were found within a region defined by c.3239\u207bc.3917, whilst 43.7% of BRCA2 mutations were located within c.7180\u207bc.8248. This study confirmed that an increase in the rate of positive tests in families with PC when associated to breast and/or ovarian tumors. Moreover, this analysis indicated two possible Pancreatic Cancer Cluster Regions that should be verified in future research. Finally, PC in families with breast and/or ovarian cancer history, particularly in BRCA families, were diagnosed at younger age and showed better one-year overall survival."

Alterations could be defined in pathways that included chromatin remodeling factors, histone methyltransferases, and mammalian target of rapamycin pathway genes. Somatic loss of heterozygosity was particularly prevalent (50 of 96 samples [52%]), and the presence of loss of heterozygosity resulted in inferior overall survival (P < .01). Sequencing of pre- and post-treatment samples revealed tumor-grade progression; clonal evolution patterns were also seen (molecular resistance mechanisms and chemotherapy-associated mutagenesis). Germline genetic analysis identified clinically actionable pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 14 of 88 patients (16%), including mutations in high-penetrance cancer susceptibility genes (MEN1, TSC2, and VHL).",

It is well documented that the risk for sporadic breast cancer disease can be modified by changing lifestyle factors that primarily include physical activity, dietary habits, and body weight.

Over the following 9\u00a0months, IG monthly group training sessions and regular telephone contacts will motivate study participants. The CG will receive one general training session about healthy nutrition in accordance with the recommendations of the German Society of Nutrition (standard of care in Germany) and the benefits of regular physical activity on health status.

We conducted a nationwide cohort study to assess the association between AD and risk of CRC. Drawing on Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database, 46,703 patients with AD (the AD cohort) and 186,812 sex, age, and index year-matched patients without AD (the non-AD cohort) were identified in the period between 2000 and 2008. Follow-up time was calculated from the date of entry in the cohort until the occurrence of a first CRC diagnosis, death, or the end of the observation period (December 31, 2013), whichever occurred first. Hazards ratios (HRs) and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs) derived from the Fine-Gray competing risk model were used to estimate the association between AD and CRC risk. After multivariable adjustment, AD was associated with an increased risk of CRC (adjusted HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.14-1.40). Of note, a significant positive association between AD and CRC risk was evident in both men and women and in all age groups. In summary, this population-based cohort study revealed that AD was associated with an increased risk of CRC in an Asian population. It will be of interest for cohort studies with prediagnostic specimens to evaluate the potential relationship between AD and CRC using biomarkers for allergy status."

Included data produced a total of 40 active versus placebo comparisons, 16 active versus active comparisons, and 64 between-genotype comparisons within treatment arms.For those meta-analyses showing statistically significant heterogeneity between genotype groups, we found the quality of evidence (GRADE) to be generally moderate. We downgraded quality most often because of imprecision or risk of bias due to potential selection bias in genotyping trial participants. Comparisons of relative treatment effects by genotypeFor six-month abstinence, we found statistically significant heterogeneity between genotypes (rs16969968) for nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) versus placebo at six months for NHB participants (P = 0.03; n = 2 trials), but not for other biomarkers or treatment comparisons. Six-month abstinence was increased in the active NRT group as compared to placebo among participants with a GG genotype (risk ratio (RR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07 to 2.03), but not in the combined group of participants with a GA or AA genotype (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.26; ratio of risk ratios (RRR) GG vs GA or AA of 3.51, 95% CI 1.19 to 10.3). Comparisons of treatment effects between genotype groups within pharmacotherapy randomisation armsFor those receiving active NRT, treatment was more effective in achieving six-month abstinence among individuals with a slow NMR than among those with a normal NMR among NHW and NHB combined participants (normal NMR vs slow NMR: RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.78; n = 2 trials).

The reader should interpret these results with caution because none of the statistically significant meta-analyses included more than two trials per genotype comparison, many confidence intervals were wide, and the quality of this evidence (GRADE) was generally moderate. Although we found evidence of superior NRT efficacy for NMR slow versus normal metabolisers, because of the lack of heterogeneity between NMR groups, we cannot conclude that NRT is more effective for slow metabolisers.

Although many smokers attempt to give up on their own, advice from a health professional increases the chances of quitting.

We pooled data from 35,969 participants.There were only four RCTs conducted in adolescence or young adults that were eligible for meta-analysis.Results for trials in adults: Eight trials compared a tailored and interactive Internet intervention to a non-active control. Pooled results demonstrated an effect in favour of the intervention (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.30, n = 6786). However, statistical heterogeneity was high (I2 = 58%) and was unexplained, and the overall quality of evidence was low according to GRADE. Five trials compared an Internet intervention to an active control. The pooled effect estimate favoured the control group, but crossed the null (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.09, n = 3806, I2 = 0%); GRADE quality rating was moderate. Five studies evaluated an Internet programme plus behavioural support compared to a non-active control (n = 2334). Pooled, these studies indicated a positive effect of the intervention (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.18). Although statistical heterogeneity was substantial (I2 = 60%) and was unexplained, the GRADE rating was moderate. Four studies evaluated the Internet plus behavioural support compared to active control. None of the studies detected a difference between trial arms (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.18, n = 2769, I2 = 0%); GRADE rating was moderate. Seven studies compared an interactive or tailored Internet intervention, or both, to an Internet intervention that was not tailored/interactive. Pooled results favoured the interactive or tailored programme, but the estimate crossed the null (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.22, n = 14,623, I2 = 0%); GRADE rating was moderate. Three studies compared tailored with non-tailored Internet-based messages, compared to non-tailored messages. The tailored messages produced higher cessation rates compared to control, but the estimate was not precise (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.41, n = 4040), and there was evidence of unexplained substantial statistical heterogeneity (I2 = 57%); GRADE rating was low.Results should be interpreted with caution as we judged some of the included studies to be at high risk of bias.",

A CRC absolute risk prediction model is applied to calculate the personalized CRC risk score with a user-friendly web survey. An interactive dashboard using advanced data visualization technics will display and interpret the risk scores and factors. Based on the risk assessment, a structured decision tree algorithm will provide the recommendations on customized CRC screening methods.
